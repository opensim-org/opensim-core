v4.0 (in development)
=====================

Converting from v3.x to v4.0
-----------------------------
- The Actuator class has been renamed to ScalarActuator (and `Actuator_` has been renamed to `Actuator`) (PR #126).
  If you have subclassed from Actuator, you must now subclass from ScalarActuator.
- Methods like `Actuator::getForce` are renamed to use "Actuator" instead (e.g., `Actuator::getActuator`) (PR #209).
- Markers are now ModelComponents (PR #188). Code is included for conversion on serialization/de-serialization.
- `Body::getMassCenter` now returns a `Vec3` instead of taking a `Vec3` reference as an argument (commit cb0697d98).
- The following virtual methods in ModelComponent have been moved:
  - connectToModel -> extendConnectToModel
  - addToSystem -> extendAddToSystem
  - initStateFromProperties -> extendInitStateFromProperties
  - setPropertiesFromState -> extendSetPropertiesFromState

  The original methods (without `extend`) still exist, but they are now non-virtual.
  To invoke `connectToModel` on an entire Model, you still call `Model::connectToModel`.
  This change has been made to make a distinction between the user interface and
  the Component developer (extension) interface. **IMPORTANT** The calls to
  `Super::addToSystem`, etc. in the implementation of these methods must now
  also use the `extend` variants. Otherwise, you will enter into an infinite recursion.
- OpenSim now makes substantial use of C++11 features; if you compile OpenSim, your compiler
  must support C++11. Also, any C++ project in which you use OpenSim must also be compiled with C++11.
- The following components have been upgraded to use Sockets to connect to
  other components they depend on (instead of string properties):
  - ContactGeometry (ContactSphere, ContactHalfSpace, ContactMesh)
- Many of the methods in ScaleTool have now been marked const.
- We created a new unified command line interface that will replace the
  single-tool command line executables (`scale`, `ik`, `id`, `rra`, `cmc`,
  etc.).
  - `scale -S setup.xml` -> `opensim run-tool setup.xml`.
  - `scale -PS` -> `opensim print-xml scale`
  - `scale -PropertyInfo ...` -> `opensim info ...`
  - `versionUpdate ...` -> `opensim update-file ...`
- The `CoordinateSet` property in `Joint` has been replaced with a `coordinates`
  list property and enumerations have been added for accessing the Coordinates
  owned by a Joint. Code like `myPlanarJoint.getCoordinateSet()[0]` now becomes
  `myPlanarJoint.getCoordinate(PlanarJoint::Coord::RotationZ)` (PRs #1116,
  #1210, and #1222).
- The `reverse` property in Joint can no longer be set by the user; Model uses
  SimTK::MultibodyGraphMaker to determine whether joints should be reversed when
  building the multibody system. The joint's transform and coordinates maintain
  a parent->child sense even if the joint has been reversed. For backwards
  compatibility, a joint's parent and child PhysicalFrames are swapped when
  opening a Model if the `reverse` element is set to `true`.
- The `Manager::integrate(SimTK::State&)` call is deprecated and replaced by
  `Manager::integrate(SimTK::State&, double)`. Here is a before-after example
  (see the documentation in the `Manager` class for more details):
  - Before:
	- manager.setInitialTime(0.0);
	- manager.setFinalTime(1.0);
	- manager.integrate(state);
  - After:
    - state.setTime(0.0);
	- manager.integrate(state, 1.0);

Composing a Component from other components
-------------------------------------------
Component now maintains a list property of *components* which it owns. You add
a (sub) Component to a *parent* Component by calling `addComponent` and passing
a heap allocated (`new Component`) to the parent which you want to take
ownership of the new subcomponent. Ownership determines how the subcomponent is serialized
(appears within the parent) and the order in which of Component interface methods (above)
are propagated to the subcomponent. Access to contained components is provided through
`getComponent<C>(path)` or `getComponentList<C>` where `C` is any Component type (default
is `Component` to get all subcomponents). These methods always traverse down into
a Component's list of components.  All subcomponents that are properties of (and thus owned by)
a parent Component are accessible this way. The Model's typed %Sets and `add####()` methods
are no longer necessary to compose a Model, since any Component can now be composed of
components. `Model` still supports `addd####()` methods and de/serialization of Sets,
but components added via `addComponent` are NOT included in the Sets but contained
in the Component's *components* property list. Details in PR#1014.

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fixed a typo in one of the method names for AbstractTool verifyUniqueComulnLabels -> verifyUniqueColumnLabels (PR #130)
- Fixed bug where Body VisibleObject was not serialized when writing a model to XML (PR #139)
- Fixed memory leaks in AssemblySolver and using Simtk::XML (PR #176)
- Fixed model mass scaling. When 'preserve mass distribution' is unchecked (GUI) the input mass was previously not respected and the resulting scaled model mass does not equal the input mass. The modelscaler() now alters the body masses and inertias to match the input mass. (PR #230)
- Fixed a bug in the equilibrium solution of Millard and Thelen muscles, where the initial activation and fiber-length values (for solving for equilibrium) were always coming from the default values. This was unnecessary, because unless specified otherwise, the state automatically contains the default values. This fixes an issue where inital states activations from a file were not respected by the Forward Tool and instead, the initial activations would revert to the model defaults. (PR #272)
- Fixed a bug where MuscleAnalysis was producing empty moment arm files. We now avoid creating empty Moment and MomentArm storage files when `_computeMoments` is False. (PR #324)

New Classes
-----------
- Added a BodyActuator component, which applies a spatial force on a specified Point of a Body (PR #126)
- Created Frame, PhysicalFrame, OffsetFrame, PhysicalOffsetFrame, Station and Marker ModelComponents (PR #188, PR #325, PR #339). Marker did not previously comply with the Model Component interface.
- A Body is a PhysicalFrame
- Connections to Bodies upgraded to PhysicalFrames and locations on these frames are now represented by PhysicalOffsetFrame (PR #370)
- Joints were refactored so that the base Joint manages the parent and child frame connections, including the definition of local PhysicalOffsetFrames to handle offsets defined as separate location and orientation properties. (PR #589)  
- The WeldConstraint and BushingForces (BushingForce, CoupledBushingForce, FunctionBasedBushingForce, and ExpressionBasedBushingForce) were similarly unified (like Joints) to handle the two Frames that these classes require to operate. A LinkTwoFrames intermediate class was introduced to house the common operations. Convenience constructors for WeldConstraint and BushingFrames were affected and now require the name of the Component as the first argument. (PR #649)
- The new StatesTrajectory class allows users to load an exact representation of previously-computed states from a file. (PR #730)
- Added Point as a new base class for all points, which include: Station, Marker, and PathPoints

Removed Classes
---------------
The following classes are no longer supported in OpenSim and are removed in OpenSim 4.0.
- Muscle class `ContDerivMuscle_Depredated`.

MATLAB and Python interfaces
----------------------------
- The SimbodyMatterSubsystem class--which provides operators related to the mass
matrix, Jacobians, inverse dynamics, etc.--is now accessible in MATLAB and
Python (PR #930).

MATLAB interface
----------------
- The configureOpenSim.m function should no longer require administrator
  privileges for most users, and gives more verbose output to assist with
  troubleshooting.

Python interface
----------------
- Improved error handling. Now, OpenSim's error messages show up as exceptions
in Python.

Other Changes
-------------
- There is now a formal CMake mechanism for using OpenSim in your own C++
  project. See cmake/SampleCMakeLists.txt. (PR #187)
- Substantial cleanup of the internal CMake scripts.
- Lepton was upgraded to the latest version (PR #349)
- Made Object::print a const member function (PR #191)
- Improved the testOptimization/OptimizationExample to reduce the runtime (PR #416)
- InverseKinematics tool outputs marker error .sto file if report error flag is true.
- Marker location file output name in IK changed to reflect trial name for batch processing.
- Created a method `ScaleTool::run()`, making it easier to run the Scale Tool
programmatically in MATLAB or python.
- Thelen2003Muscle, Millard2012EquilibriumMuscle, and
  Millard2012AccelerationMuscle now throw an exception if the force equilibrium
  calculation fails to converge (PR #1201).
- Thelen2003Muscle and Millard2012EquilibriumMuscle no longer clamp excitations (i.e. controls)
  internally. If controls are out of bounds an Exception is thrown. Also, the
  `min_control` property now defaults to the `minimum_activation`. It is the
  responsibility of the controller (or solver) to provide controls that are
  within the valid ranges defined by the Actuators and that includes the
  specific bounds of Muscle models. (PR #1548)
- The `buildinfo.txt` file, which contains the name of the compiler used to
  compile OpenSim and related information, is now named `OpenSim_buildinfo.txt`
  and may be installed in a different location.
- macOS and Linux users should no longer need to set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or
  `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` to use OpenSim libraries.

Documentation
--------------
- Improved Doxygen layout and fixed several bugs and warnings (various)
- All mentions of SimTK/Simbody classes in OpenSim's Doxygen now provide links directly to SimTK/Simbody's doxygen.
- Added a detailed README.md wtith build instructions, as well as guides to contributing and developing (CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Included GIFs in Doxygen for several commonly used Joint types

STILL NEED TO ADD:
- Additional changes to Model Component Interface, Iterator (any PRs labeled "New MCI")
- PR #364
- PR #370
- PR #378
