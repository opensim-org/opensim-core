Integrate into opensim-core?

For:

- more exposure to users; easier for users to obtain the software.
- easier conceptually for users: not so many different pieces.
- easier to maintain fewer separate projects
- unified documentation
- easier to build matlab/python bindings.
- easier in dev b/c i can make changes to core as necessary.

Against:

- must pass thorough review.
- increases opensim-core build time
- adds many dependencies to opensim-core.
- can swap out different versions of opensim-core.

TBD:

- would putting it in opensim-core make it public too soon?


Use this as a model for how to handle contributions in the future.

Muscollo could be an add-on, and if other pple pass some scrutiny, they can also
be pulled into the distribution as an add-on.

 opensim-core: more work int he review, but don't have to handle coordinating
 multiple repos.
