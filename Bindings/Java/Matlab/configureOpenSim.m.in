function configureOpenSim()
%% configureOpenSim() adds OpenSim library paths to MATLAB path files.
%    Once run, you will have access to the OpenSim API in MATLAB:
%
%        >> import org.opensim.modeling.*;
%        >> model = Model();
%
%    This script also adds some OpenSim MATLAB utility functions to your MATLAB
%    path (e.g., for converting OpenSim data tables to MATLAB structs).
%    
%    Windows users must ensure OpenSim's bin directory is on the operating
%    system's PATH (search for "environment" in the Windows start menu). 
%    OpenSim's installer usually does this for you.
%
%    Linux users must ensure OpenSim's lib directory on the library path
%    (LD_LIBRRAY_PATH), and may need to replace MATLAB's libstdc++ 
%    (see https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-core/issues/1397).
%
%    Depending on your operating system, this function may require
%    administrator (or sudo) privileges to succeed.
%
%    For this function to work, it must be located in its original place 
%    in the OpenSim installation: @OPENSIM_INSTALL_MATLABEXDIR@
%
% What this function does:
%    This function adds (a) the location of org-opensim-modeling.jar 
%    (the OpenSim Java bindings) to MATLAB's Java class path 
%    (javaclasspath.txt), (b) the location of OpenSim's shared
%    libraries (.dll on Windows, .so on Linux, .dylib on macOS) to
%    MATLAB's Java library path (javalibrarypath.txt), and (c) the location of
%    OpenSim's MATLAB Utilities to the MATLAB path (e.g., addpath).
%
% Removing existing OpenSim paths:
%    This function tries detect any OpenSim installations you may have
%    previously configured with MATLAB, and removes them from the Java class
%    path, Java library path, and MATLAB path (all 3 items above).
%  
% MATLAB versions older than 2012b:
%    If your MATLAB version is older than 2012b, we must use an older mechanism
%    for setting the Java class path and Java library path. This older
%    mechanism likely requires administrator (sudo) privileges, as it involves
%    editing files within the MATLAB installation.
%
%    This function requires MATLAB 2007b or later to run.
