## Documentation

OpenSim's documentation can be found in our [Documentation](https://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu/display/OpenSim/Documentation) website. 
OpenSim's C++ API reference can be found [here](https://simtk.org/api_docs/opensim/api_docs/).

A simple example of an elbow simulation in C++, Python and Matlab can be found in the [OpenSim API Example](https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-core/wiki/OpenSim-API-Example) page of this repository's wiki.

Examples and Tutorials for OpenSim can be found in the [Examples and tutorials](https://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu/display/OpenSim/Examples+and+Tutorials) website. These tutorials move from introductory to more advanced, so you can learn OpenSim in a progressive way. Additional OpenSim-based tutorials, homework problems, and project ideas are available on the [Biomechanics of Movement classroom site](https://simtk-confluence-homeworks.stanford.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=5537857).
