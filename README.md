OpenSim Core [![Travis][buildstatus_image_travis]][travisci] [![Appveyor][buildstatus_image_appveyor]][appveyorci]
============

OpenSim is software that lets users develop models of musculoskeletal
structures and create dynamic simulations of movement, such as this one:

More information can be found at our websites:

* [OpenSim website](http://opensim.stanford.edu); in particular, the [support
  page](http://opensim.stanford.edu/support/index.html).
* [SimTK project website](https://simtk.org/home/opensim)

This repository contains the source code for OpenSim's C++ libraries, C++
examples, command-line applications (inverse kinematics, computed muscle
control, etc.), and Java and Python wrapping. This repository does *not*
include source code for the OpenSim GUI.


Simple example
--------------
Let's simulate a simple arm whose elbow is actuated by a muscle:
```cpp
#include <OpenSim/OpenSim.h>
using namespace SimTK;
using namespace OpenSim; using OpenSim::Body;
int main() {
    Model model; model.setUseVisualizer(true);
    // Two links, with mass of 1 kg, center of mass at the
    // origin of the body's frame, and moments/products of inertia of zero.
    OpenSim::Body* link1 = new OpenSim::Body("humerus", 1, Vec3(0), Inertia(0));
    OpenSim::Body* link2 = new OpenSim::Body("radius", 1, Vec3(0), Inertia(0));

    // Joints that connect the bodies together.
    PinJoint* joint1 = new PinJoint("shoulder",
            // Parent body, location in parent, orientation in parent.
            model.getGround(), Vec3(0), Vec3(0),
            // Child body, location in child, orientation in child.
            *link1, Vec3(0, 1, 0), Vec3(0));
    PinJoint* joint2 = new PinJoint("elbow",
            *link1, Vec3(0), Vec3(0), *link2, Vec3(0, 1, 0), Vec3(0));

    // Add an actuator that crosses the elbow, and a joint stop.
    Millard2012EquilibriumMuscle* muscle = new
        Millard2012EquilibriumMuscle("biceps", 200, 0.6, 0.55, 0);
    muscle->addNewPathPoint("point1", *link1, Vec3(0, 0.8, 0));
    muscle->addNewPathPoint("point2", *link2, Vec3(0, 0.7, 0));

    // A controller that specifies the excitation of the biceps muscle.
    PrescribedController* brain = new PrescribedController();
    brain->addActuator(*muscle);
    // Muscle excitation is 0.3 for the first 0.5 seconds, and 1.0 thereafter.
    brain->prescribeControlForActuator("biceps",
            new StepFunction(0.5, 3, 0.3, 1));

    // Add bodies and joints to the model.
    model.addBody(link1); model.addBody(link2);
    model.addJoint(joint1); model.addJoint(joint2);
    model.addForce(muscle);
    model.addController(brain);

    // Configure the model.
    State& state = model.initSystem();
    // Fix shoulder joint, flex elbow joint.
    model.updCoordinateSet()[0].setLocked(state, true);
    model.updCoordinateSet()[1].setValue(state, 0.5 * Pi);
    model.equilibrateMuscles(state);

    // Add display geometry.
    model.updMatterSubsystem().setShowDefaultGeometry(true);
    Visualizer& viz = model.updVisualizer().updSimbodyVisualizer();
    viz.setBackgroundColor(Vec3(1, 1, 1));
    // Ellipsoids: 0.5 m radius along y axis, centered 0.5 m up along y axis.
    DecorativeEllipsoid geom(Vec3(0.1, 0.5, 0.1)); Vec3 center(0, 0.5, 0);
    viz.addDecoration(link1->getMobilizedBodyIndex(), Transform(center), geom);
    viz.addDecoration(link2->getMobilizedBodyIndex(), Transform(center), geom);

    // Simulate.
    RungeKuttaMersonIntegrator integrator(model.getSystem());
    Manager manager(model, integrator);
    manager.setInitialTime(0); manager.setFinalTime(10.0);
    manager.integrate(state);
};
```

This code produces the following animation:

Building from the source code
-----------------------------

We support a few ways of building OpenSim:

1. [On Windows using Microsoft Visual Studio](#on-windows-using-visual-studio).
2. [On Mac using Xcode](#on-mac-using-xcode).
3. [On Ubuntu using Unix Makefiles](#on-ubuntu-using-unix-makefiles).


On Windows using Visual Studio
------------------------------

#### Get the dependencies

* **operating system**: Windows 7 or 8.
* **cross-platform build system**:
  [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html) >= 2.8.8
* **compiler / IDE**: Visual Studio 2013. We recommended either:
    * *Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop*, which is free, or
    * *Visual Studio Professional 2013* through
      [Dreamspark](https://www.dreamspark.com) if you are at an academic
      institution.
* **physics engine**:
  [Simbody](https://github.com/simbody/simbody#windows-and-visual-studio) >= 3.4
* **API documentation** (optional):
  [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html) >= 1.8.6
* **version control** (optional): git. There are many options:
    * [Git for Windows](http://msysgit.github.io/), most advanced;
    * [TortoiseGit](https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/wiki/Download),
      intermediate; good for TortoiseSVN users;
    * [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/), easiest.
* **Wrapping** (optional): [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/) 2.0.10
    * **MATLAB scripting** (optional): [Java development kit][java] 1.6.
    * **python scripting** (optional):
        * [Enthought Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/), or
        * [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/)

#### Download the OpenSim-Core source code

* Method 1; If you want to get going quickly, download the source code from
  https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-core/releases, for the version of
  OpenSim you want. We'll assume you unzipped the source code into
  `C:/opensim-core-source`.
* Method 2: If you plan on updating your OpenSim installation or you want to
  contribute back to the project, clone the opensim-core git repository into
  `C:/opensim-core-source`. If using TortoiseGit, open Windows Explorer,
  right-click in the window, select **Git Clone...**, and provide the
  following:
    * **URL**: `https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-core.git`.
    * **Directory**: `C:/opensim-core-source`.

  If using a Git Bash or Git Shell, run the following:

        $ git clone https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-core.git C:/opensim-core-source

  This will give you a bleeding-edge version of OpenSim-Core.

#### Configure and generate project files

1. Open CMake.
2. In the field **Where is the source code**, specify `C:/opensim-core-source`.
3. In the field **Where to build the binaries**, specify something like
   `C:/opensim-core-build`, or some other path that is not inside your source
   directory. This is *not* where we are installing OpenSim-Core; see below.
4. Click the **Configure** button.
    1. Choose the *Visual Studio 12* generator (for Visual Studio 2013). To
       build as 64-bit, select *Visual Studio 12 Win64*.
    2. Click **Finish**.
5. Where do you want to install OpenSim-Core on your computer? Set this by
   changing the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` variable. We'll assume you set it to
   `C:/opensim-core`. If you choose a different installation location, make
   sure to use *yours* where we use `C:/opensim-core` below.
6. Tell CMake where you installed Simbody by setting the `SIMBODY_HOME`
   variable to where you installed Simbody (e.g., `C:/Simbody`).
7. Set the remaining configuration options.
    * `BUILD_EXAMPLES` to compile C++ API examples.
    * `BUILD_TESTING` to ensure that OpenSim works correctly. The tests take a
      while to build; if you want to build OpenSim quickly, you can turn this
      off.
    * `BUILD_JAVA_WRAPPING` if you want to access OpenSim through MATLAB or
      Java; see dependencies above.
    * `BUILD_PYTHON_WRAPPING` if you want to access OpenSim through Python; see
      dependencies above.
    * `BUILD_API_ONLY` if you don't want to build the command-line applications.
8. Click the **Configure** button again. Then, click **Generate** to make
   Visual Studio project files in the build directory.

#### Build and install

1. Open `C:/opensim-core-build/OpenSim.sln` in Visual Studio.
2. Select your desired *Solution configuration* from the drop-down at the top.
    * **Debug**: debugger symbols; no optimizations (more than 10x slower).
      Library names end with `_d`.
    * **Release**: no debugger symbols; optimized.
    * **RelWithDebInfo**: debugger symbols; optimized. Bigger but not slower
      than Release; choose this if unsure.
    * **MinSizeRel**: minimum size; optimized.

    You at least want release libraries (the last 3 count as release), but you
    can have debug libraries coexist with them. To do this, go through the
    installation process twice, once for each of the two configurations. You
    should install the release configuration *last* to ensure that you use the
    release version of the command-line applications instead of the slow debug
    versions.
3. Build the API documentation. This is optional, and you can only do this if
   you have Doxygen. Build the documentation by right-clicking **doxygen** and
   selecting **Build**.
4. Build the libraries, etc. by right-clicking  **ALL_BUILD** and selecting
   **Build**.
5. Run the tests by right-clicking **RUN_TESTS_PARALLEL** and selecting
   **Build**.
6. Install OpenSim-Core by right-clicking **INSTALL** and selecting **Build**.

#### Set environment variables

In order to use the OpenSim-Core command-line applications or use OpenSim-Core
libraries in your own application, you must add the OpenSim-Core `bin/`
directory to your `PATH` environment variable.

1. In the Start menu (Windows 7) or screen (Windows 8), search `environment`.
2. Select **Edit the system environment variables**.
3. Click **Environment Variables...**.
4. Under **System variables**, click **Path**, then click **Edit**.
5. Add **C:/opensim-core/bin;** to the front of of the text field. Don't forget
   the semicolon!


On Mac using Xcode
==================

#### Get the dependencies

* **operating system**: OS X 10.8 or later.
* **cross-platform build system**:
  [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html) >= 2.8.8
* **compiler / IDE**: [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) >= 5, through
  the Mac App Store.
* **physics engine**:
  [Simbody](https://github.com/simbody/simbody#installing) >= 3.5.
  **Important**: If installing Simbody 3.5 using Makefile's, make sure Simbody's
  CMake variable `SIMBODY_STANDARD_11` is turned on (in 3.6 and later, this variable
  is removed).
* **API documentation** (optional):
  [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html) >= 1.8.6
* **version control** (optional): git.
    * Xcode Command Line Tools gives you git on the command line.
    * [GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com), easiest.
* **Wrapping** (optional): [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/) 2.0.10
    * **MATLAB scripting** (optional): [Java development kit][java] 1.6.
    * **python scripting** (optional):
        * Mac's come with python, but you could also install:
        * [Enthought Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/), or
        * [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/)

#### Download the OpenSim-Core source code

* Method 1; If you want to get going quickly, download the source code from
  https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-core/releases, for the version of
  OpenSim you want. We'll assume you unzipped the source code into
  `~/opensim-core-source`.
* Method 2: If you plan on updating your OpenSim installation or you want to
  contribute back to the project, clone the opensim-core git repository into
  `~/opensim-core-source`. Run the following in a terminal, or
  find a way to run the equivalent commands in a GUI client:

        $ git clone https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-core.git ~/opensim-core-source

  This will give you a bleeding-edge version of OpenSim-Core.

#### Configure and generate project files

1. Open CMake.
2. In the field **Where is the source code**, specify `~/opensim-core-source`.
3. In the field **Where to build the binaries**, specify something like
   `~/opensim-core-build`, or some other path that is not inside your source
   directory. This is *not* where we are installing OpenSim-Core; see below.
4. Click the **Configure** button. Choose **Xcode**. Click **Finish**.
5. Where do you want to install OpenSim-Core on your computer? Set this by
   changing the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` variable. We'll assume you set it to
   `~/opensim-core`. If you choose a different installation location, make
   sure to use *yours* where we use `~/opensim-core` below. You should *not*
   use `/usr/`, `/usr/local/` (because our installation does not yet conform to the [FHS](http://www.pathname.com/fhs/)).
6. Tell CMake where you installed Simbody by setting the `SIMBODY_HOME`
   variable to where you installed Simbody (e.g., `~/simbody`). If you
   installed Simbody using `brew`, then CMake will find Simbody automatically.
7. Set the remaining configuration options.
    * `BUILD_EXAMPLES` to compile C++ API examples.
    * `BUILD_TESTING` to ensure that OpenSim works correctly. The tests take a
      while to build; if you want to build OpenSim quickly, you can turn this
      off.
    * `BUILD_JAVA_WRAPPING` if you want to access OpenSim through MATLAB or
      Java; see dependencies above.
    * `BUILD_PYTHON_WRAPPING` if you want to access OpenSim through Python; see
      dependencies above.
    * `BUILD_API_ONLY` if you don't want to build the command-line applications.
8. Click the **Configure** button again. Then, click **Generate** to create
   Xcode project files in the build directory.

#### Build and install

1. Open `~/opensim-core-build/OpenSim.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
2. Choose your **Build Configuration** for the **ALL_BUILD** Scheme by pressing
   `Command-Shift ,` (or, `Command-LessThan`), or navigating to **Product ->
   Scheme -> Edit Scheme...**; and changing the **Build Configuration** field.
    * **Debug**: debugger symbols; no optimizations (more than 10x slower).
    Library names end with `_d`.
    * **Release**: no debugger symbols; optimized.
    * **RelWithDebInfo**: debugger symbols; optimized. Bigger but not slower
    than Release; choose this if unsure.
    * **MinSizeRel**: minimum size; optimized.

    You at least want release libraries (the last 3 count as release), but you
    can have debug libraries coexist with them. To do this, go through the
    installation process twice, once for each of the two configurations. You
    should install the release configuration *last* to ensure that you use the
    release version of the command-line applications instead of the slow debug
    versions.

3. Compile. Run the Scheme **ALL_BUILD** by clicking the play button in the
   upper left.
4. Test. Click on **ALL_BUILD** in the upper left, and select
   **RUN_TESTS_PARALLEL**. Change the **Build Configuration** of this Scheme to
   the same as you used for **ALL_BUILD** (using the same instructions as
   above). Click the play button.
5. Build the API documentation. This is optional, and you can only do this if
   you have Doxygen. Click on the current Scheme (**RUN_TESTS_PARALLEL**) and
   select **doxygen**. Click the play button.
6. Install. Click on the current Scheme (**RUN_TESTS_PARALLEL** or
   **doxygen**), and select **install**. Click the play button.

#### Set environment variables

1. Allow executables to find OpenSim-Core libraries by adding the OpenSim-Core
   `lib/` directory to your linker path. Open a terminal and type:

        $ echo 'export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/opensim-core/lib' >> ~/.bash_profile

2. Add OpenSim-Core's executables to the path so you can access them from any
   directory on your computer. *Note* some of the names of OpenSim-Core
   executables conflict with some UNIX commands (e.g., `id`). To give
   preference to OpenSim-Core's executables, we must *prepend* OpenSim-Core's
   `bin/` directory to the path. Open a terminal and type:

        $ echo 'export PATH=~/opensim-core/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile

Your changes will only take effect in new terminal windows.


On Ubuntu using Unix Makefiles
==============================

#### Get the dependencies

Most dependencies can be obtained via the Ubuntu software repositories. On each
line below, we show the corresponding package.

* **operating system**: Ubuntu 13.10 or later.
* **cross-platform build system**:
  [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html) >= 2.8.8;
  `cmake-gui`. Ubuntu 12.04 only has 2.8.6 available; download from the website
  or from this [third party
  PPA](https://launchpad.net/~robotology/+archive/ubuntu/ppa).
* **compiler**: [gcc](http://gcc.gnu.org) >= 4.8; `g++-4.8`, or
      [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org) >= 3.4; `clang-3.4`.
* **physics engine**:
  [Simbody](https://github.com/simbody/simbody#installing) >= 3.5.
  **Important**: If installing Simbody 3.5 using Makefile's, make sure Simbody's
  CMake variable `SIMBODY_STANDARD_11` is turned on (in 3.6 and later, this variable
  is removed).
* **API documentation** (optional):
  [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html) >= 1.8.6;
  `doxygen`.
* **version control** (optional): git; `git`.
* **Wrapping** (optional): [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/) 2.0.10 `swig`
    * **MATLAB scripting** (optional): [Java development kit][java] >= 1.6;
      `openjdk-6-jdk` or `openjdk-7-jdk`.
    * **python scripting** (optional): `python-dev`.

For example, you could get the required dependencies (except Simbody) via:

    $ sudo apt-get install cmake-gui g++-4.8

And you could get all the optional dependencies via:

    $ sudo apt-get install doxygen git swig openjdk-7-jdk python-dev

#### Download the OpenSim-Core source code

1. Open CMake.
2. In the field **Where is the source code**, specify `~/opensim-core-source`.
3. In the field **Where to build the binaries**, specify something like
   `~/opensim-core-build`, or some other path that is not inside your source
   directory. This is *not* where we are installing OpenSim-Core; see below.
4. Click the **Configure** button. Choose *Unix Makefiles*. Click **Finish**.
5. Where do you want to install OpenSim-Core on your computer? Set this by
   changing the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` variable. We'll assume you set it to
   `~/opensim-core`. If you choose a different installation location, make
   sure to use *yours* where we use `~/opensim-core` below. You should *not*
   use `/usr/`, `/usr/local/` (because our installation does not yet conform to the [FHS](http://www.pathname.com/fhs/)), but [`/opt/`](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/html/opt.html) is okay.
6. Tell CMake where you installed Simbody by setting the `SIMBODY_HOME`
   variable to where you installed Simbody (e.g., `~/simbody`). If you
   installed Simbody using `brew`, then CMake will find Simbody automatically.
7. Choose your build type by setting `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` to one of the following:
    * **Debug**: debugger symbols; no optimizations (more than 10x slower).
    Library names end with `_d`.
    * **Release**: no debugger symbols; optimized.
    * **RelWithDebInfo**: debugger symbols; optimized. Bigger but not slower
    than Release; choose this if unsure.
    * **MinSizeRel**: minimum size; optimized.

    You at least want release libraries (the last 3 count as release), but you
    can have debug libraries coexist with them. To do this, go through the
    installation process twice, once for each of the two configurations. It is
    typical to use a different build directory for each build type (e.g.,
    `~/opensim-core-build-debug` and `~/opensim-core-build-release`). You
    should install the release configuration *last* to ensure that you use the
    release version of the command-line applications instead of the slow debug
    versions.
8. Set the remaining configuration options.
    * `BUILD_EXAMPLES` to compile C++ API examples.
    * `BUILD_TESTING` to ensure that OpenSim works correctly. The tests take a
      while to build; if you want to build OpenSim quickly, you can turn this
      off.
    * `BUILD_JAVA_WRAPPING` if you want to access OpenSim through MATLAB or
      Java; see dependencies above.
    * `BUILD_PYTHON_WRAPPING` if you want to access OpenSim through Python; see
      dependencies above.
    * `BUILD_API_ONLY` if you don't want to build the command-line applications.
9. Click the **Configure** button again. Then, click **Generate** to create
   Makefiles in the build directory.

#### Build and install

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the build directory.

        $ cd ~/opensim-core-build

2. Build the API documentation. This is optional, and you can only do this if
   you have Doxygen.

        $ make doxygen

3. Compile. Use the `-jn` flag to build using `n` concurrent jobs (potentially
   in parallel); this will greatly speed up your build. For example:

        $ make -j8

4. Run the tests.

        $ ctest -j8

5. Install (to `~/opensim-core`).

        $ make -j8 install

#### Set environment variables

1. Allow executables to find OpenSim-Core libraries by adding the OpenSim-Core
   `lib/` directory to your linker path.

        $ echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/opensim-core/lib' >> ~/.bashrc

2. Add OpenSim-Core's executables to the path so you can access them from any
   directory on your computer. NOTE that some of the names of OpenSim-Core
   executables conflict with some UNIX commands (e.g., `id`). To give
   preference to OpenSim-Core's executables, we must *prepend* OpenSim-Core's
   `bin/` directory to the path.

        $ echo 'export PATH=~/opensim-core/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
