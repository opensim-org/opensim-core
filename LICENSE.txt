How to Acknowledge Us
---------------------
Acknowledging the OpenSim project helps us and helps you. It allows us to track
our impact, which is essential for securing funding to improve the software and
provide support to our users (you).

If you use the OpenSim GUI, you must acknowledge the OpenSim project where
appropriate, by citing the following paper. If you only use the OpenSim API, you
are not required to acknowledge us, but we would be extremely grateful if you
did so anyway.

Delp SL, Anderson FC, Arnold AS, Loan P, Habib A, John CT, Guendelman E, Thelen
DG. OpenSim: Open-source Software to Create and Analyze Dynamic Simulations of
Movement. IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering. (2007)

We would also be grateful if you mention that OpenSim is funded by NIH Roadmap
grant U54 GM072970, the NIH research infrastructure grant R24 HD065690, and the
DARPA Warrior Web Program. We greatly appreciate this support, and the NIH and
DARPA appreciate knowing that their funds are having an impact, particularly on
medical research and human health.

If you use plugins, models, or other components contributed by your fellow
researchers, you must acknowledge their work as described in the license that
accompanies each of these files.
