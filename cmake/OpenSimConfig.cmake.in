# This config file defines the following variables:
#   @CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@_FOUND
#       True if search for libraries and headers succeeds.
#   @CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@_ROOT_DIR
#       The installation directory.
#   @CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@_LIB_DIR
#       The directory containing libraries. Suitable for link_directories().
#   @CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@_INCLUDE_DIRS
#       Suitable for include_directories().
#   @CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@_LIBRARIES
#       Suitable for target_link_libraries().
#   @CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@_JAVA_WRAPPING
#       Boolean indicating whether or not OpenSim was built to include Java
#       wrapping.
#   @CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@_JAR_FILE
#       Path to Java wrapping's jar file.
#   @CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@_JAVA_FILES_DIR
#       Directory containing the Java source files.
#   @CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@_PYTHON_WRAPPING
#       Boolean indicating whether or not OpenSim was built to include Python
#       wrapping.
#   @CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@_PYTHON_PACKAGE_DIR
#       Directory containing the OpenSim Python package.
#                                            
# This file will also find Simbody; you do not
# need to use `find_package(Simbody)` in your own project. If OpenSim's
# installation does *not* contain Simbody (and BTK), you might need to set
# CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH to the directory containing Simbody, and make sure that BTK
# libraries are available during runtime.
