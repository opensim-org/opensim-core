# installation on your machine so you can use it from your own code.
# You will most likely want to copy some of these lines into your own
# CMakeLists.txt rather than use this one verbatim.

# on your machine. If you have installed it somewhere that CMake won't be
# able to guess, you'll need to tell find_package where to look, or
# specify the installation directory in the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH variable.
