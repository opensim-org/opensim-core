# installation on your machine so you can use it from your own code.

# CMakeLists.txt rather than use this one verbatim.

# This depends on OpenSimConfig.cmake being located somewhere predictable
# on your machine. If you have installed it somewhere that CMake won't be
# able to guess, you'll need to tell find_package where to look (with the PATHS
# or HINTS parameters), or specify the installation directory in the
# CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH variable.
