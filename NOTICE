How to Acknowledge Us
---------------------
Acknowledging the OpenSim project helps us and helps you. It allows us to track
our impact, which is essential for securing funding to improve the software and
provide support to our users (you). We would be extremely grateful if you
acknowledge us by citing the following papers.

Delp SL, Anderson FC, Arnold AS, Loan P, Habib A, John CT, Guendelman E, Thelen
DG. OpenSim: Open-source Software to Create and Analyze Dynamic Simulations of
Movement. IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering. (2007)

Seth A, Sherman M, Reinbolt JA,  Delp SL. OpenSim: a musculoskeletal modeling
and simulation framework for in silico investigations and exchange.
Procedia IUTAM. (2011)

Please note that OpenSim employs its own exact method of computing moment-arms 
and does not numerically compute the partial derivative of muscle length w.r.t.
joint angle. Please use the following when for a reference to how OpenSim computes 
moment-arms.

Sherman MA, Seth A, Delp SL. What is a Moment Arm? Calculating Muscle Effectiveness
in Biomechanical Models Using Generalized Coordinates. ASME. International Design
Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering
Conference, Volume 7B: 9th International Conference on Multibody Systems, Nonlinear
Dynamics, and Control. (2013)

We would also be grateful if you mention that OpenSim is funded by NIH Roadmap
grant U54 GM072970, the NIH research infrastructure grant P2C HD065690, the NIH
BD2K Initiative grant U54 EB020405 and the DARPA Warrior Web Program. We greatly 
appreciate this support, and the NIH and DARPA appreciate knowing that their funds 
are having an impact, particularly on medical research and human health.

If you use plugins, models, or other components contributed by your fellow
researchers, you must acknowledge their work as described in the license that
accompanies each of these files.
