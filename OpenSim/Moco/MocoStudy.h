/** The top-level class for solving a custom optimal control problem.

This class consists of a MocoProblem, which describes the optimal control
problem, and a MocoSolver, which describes the numerical method for
solving the problem.

Workflow
========
When building a MocoStudy programmatically (e.g., in C++), the workflow is
as follows:

1. Build the MocoProblem (set the model, constraints, etc.).
2. Call MocoStudy::initSolver(), which returns a reference to the
MocoSolver.
   After this, you cannot edit the MocoProblem.
3. Edit the settings of the MocoSolver (returned by initSolver()).
4. Call MocoStudy::solve(). This returns the MocoSolution.
5. (Optional) Postprocess the solution, perhaps using
MocoStudy::visualize().

After calling solve(), you can edit the MocoProblem and/or the MocoSolver.
You can then call solve() again, if you wish.

Obtaining the solution
----------------------
The most common way to obtain the MocoStudy is in code, using the MocoSolution
object returned by solve(). This norm differs from the behavior of OpenSim's
other tools, which do not make their results available in code and instead write
their results to file. If you want MocoStudy to write the solution to file at
the end of solve(), use set_write_solution() and set_results_directory(). The
name of the solution file is "<study-name>_solution.sto" or
"MocoStudy_solution.sto" if the MocoStudy object has no name. Alternatively, you
can write the solution to file yourself:

@code
MocoSolution solution = study.solve();
solution.write("solution.sto");
@endcode

Saving the study setup to a file
--------------------------------
You can save the MocoStudy to a file by calling MocoStudy::print(), and you
can load the setup using MocoStudy(const std::string& omocoFile).
MocoStudy setup files have a `.omoco` extension.

Solver
------
The default solver, MocoCasADiSolver, uses the **CasADi** automatic
differentiation and optimization library. Moco also provides the
MocoTropterSolver, which uses the **tropter** optimal control library that is
part of the OpenSim project. If you want to use MocoTropterSolver instead of
MocoCasADiSolver, call initTropterSolver() before solve(). We would like to
support users plugging in their own solvers, but there is no timeline for this.
