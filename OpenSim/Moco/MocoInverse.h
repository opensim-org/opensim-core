/** This tool solves problems in which the kinematics are prescribed and you
seek the actuator (e.g., muscle) behavior that may have given rise to the
provided kinematics. The term "inverse" describes methods that estimate
quantities from an observation; on the other hand, "forward" methods attempt
to predict (unobserved) behavior. In this case, "inverse" refers to the
multibody systems. This class can still be used to simulate muscles in a
"forward" or predictive sense.

The kinematics file must provide values for all coordinates (even those
labeled as dependent in a CoordinateCouplerConstraint); missing coordinates
are set to NaN.

The provided trajectory is altered to satisfy any enabled kinematic
constraints in the model.

# Cost
By default, MocoInverse minimizes the sum of squared controls and
constrains initial activation to be equal to initial excitation (to avoid
initial activation spikes). To customize the cost, invoke initialize(), add
costs manually, and solve the problem using the solver directly. Note,
however, that kinematic states are not included in the solution if you use
the solver directly.

# Default solver settings
- solver: MocoCasADiSolver
- multibody_dynamics_mode: implicit
- interpolate_control_midpoints: false
- minimize_implicit_auxiliary_derivatives: true
- implicit_auxiliary_derivatives_weight: 0.01
- optim_convergence_tolerance: 1e-3
- optim_constraint_tolerance: 1e-3
- optim_sparsity_detection: random
- optim_finite_difference_scheme: forward

If you would like to use settings other than these defaults, see "Customizing
a problem" below.

MocoInverse minimizes the sum of squared controls and, optionally, the sum
of squared activations. As MocoInverse becomes more mature and general, the
costs will become more flexible.

# Mesh interval
A smaller mesh interval increases the convergence time, but is necessary
for fast motions or problems with stiff differential equations (e.g.,
stiff tendons).
For gait, consider using a mesh interval between 0.01 and 0.05 seconds.
Try solving your problem with decreasing mesh intervals and choose a mesh
interval at which the solution stops changing noticeably.

# Basic example

This example shows how to use MocoInverse in C++:

@code
MocoInverse inverse;
inverse.setName("prescribed_motion");
inverse.setModel(ModelProcessor("model_file.osim") |
                 ModOpAddExternalLoads("external_loads.xml") |
                 ModOpAddReserves());
inverse.setKinematics(TableProcessor("states_reference_file.sto"));
inverse.set_mesh_interval(0.02);
MocoInverseSolution solution = inverse.solve();
solution.getMocoSolution().write("MocoInverse_solution.sto");
@endcode

Customizing the tool
--------------------
The example below shows how you can customize the MocoInverse tool by obtaining
the underlying MocoStudy. You can change the "Default solver settings" above
and add additional goals.

@code
MocoInverse inverse;
inverse.setName("prescribed_motion");
inverse.setModel(ModelProcessor("model_file.osim") |
                 ModOpAddExternalLoads("external_loads.xml") |
                 ModOpAddReserves(1));
inverse.setKinematics(TableProcessor("states_reference_file.sto"));
inverse.set_mesh_interval(0.02);
MocoStudy study = inverse.initialize();
MocoProblem& problem = study.updProblem();
auto* emg_tracking = problem.addGoal<MocoControlTrackingGoal>("emg_tracking");
emg_tracking->setReference(TimeSeriesTable("electromyography.sto"));
auto& solver = study.updSolver<MocoCasADiSolver>();
solver.set_optim_convergence_tolerance(1e-4);
MocoSolution solution = study.solve();
solution.write("MocoInverse_solution.sto");
@endcode

Do NOT change the multibody_dynamics_mode solver setting, as setting this to
"implicit" is vital to how MocoInverse works.
