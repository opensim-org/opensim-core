/**
 A Solver to compute the induced accelerations of an applied "force" acting
 on the model. The solver can applyg constraints to replace external (contact)
 forces in order to decompose contributions of external reaction forces and to
 subsequentlt determine the induced (generalized) accelerations (udot).
 The solver can compute the induced acceleration and constraint reaction force
 contributions for any model Force. 
 
 The solver converts the unconstrained system:

(1)  [M]*udot = G(q) + V(q,u) + S(t, q,u) + F(t, q, u, z, x)
        where G = gravitational, V = velocity dependent, S = external
        or contact forces w.r.t. to ground and F are all other applied
        model forces like motors and muscles.
        q generalized coordinates, u mobilities (gen speeds, qdot = [N]*u)
        z other state variables (e.g. muscle fiber lengths), x controls
        t time, q, u, and z constitute the State of the model

 to a constrained system:
(2a) [M]*udot = G(q) + V(q,u) -[~C]*lambda + F(t, q, u, z, x)
(2b) [C]*udot = b(t,q,u) 
        by replacing the external forces or passive contact force S with
        rigid kinematic constraints imposed on the system acceleration
        ([C] and b obtained by differentiating position and velocity
         constraints) and enforced in the system dynamics by Lagrange
         multipliers, lambda. 
    NOTE: The validity of the constraints can be tested by the accuracy 
          by which [~C]*lambda can reconstitute S, when all forces are 
          applied.

    Eqn 2 is linear in both udot (accelerations) and external (or contact)
     forces and the contribution of applied forces to the model's
     accelerations (udot_i) and external forces (reaction_i) can be directly
     evaluated. The contribution of a force (like gravity or a muscle) to the
     system acceleration is called its "induced acceleration" and the 
     contribution to the reaction (or external) force is its "induced reaction".
     
     NOTE, the sum of induced accelerations and reactions MUST must total to
     the complete system acceleration or external force when all model forces
     are applied.  
     
 The solver can apply any OpenSim::Constraint that implements
 setContactPointForInducedAccelerations() to replace external and/or contact 
 forces that are applied during a forward dynamics simulation.
