/**
This function is a muscle modeling utility class that simulates
dynamics of muscle force development as a function of input excitation.
Though it has been long been assumed that a second-order, critically damped
filter models the twitch response of muscle very accurately (Bellmare et al)
first order models have persisted in the literature. Zajac originally chose
to use first order, rather than second order equations in an effort to
reduce simulation times. First order activation dynamics were later
popularized in two influential muscle modeling papers by Winters in 1995,
and later by Thelen in 2003. Computing power is far greater today than it
was at the time Zajac wrote his influential muscle modeling paper, and so it
makes sense to include activation dynamics that more closely match the
experimental literature.

The figure shows that
there are very large differences in the impulse response between a first
order system (filled grey area), and Bellmare et al.'s experimental data
(thick grey line). The first order system has an instantaneous rise time,
reaches a peak value when the impulse terminates (in 0 time).
Additionally the impulse response of the second order system is
orders of magnitude higher than the second order system (peaking at a
value of just under 0.01), and so, its peak is not shown in the figure.
The second order system peaks at the same time as Bellmare et al.'s
experimental data, and then slowly decays. These plots suggest that a
second order system decays far slower than the experiments indicate.

\image html fig_MuscleSecondOrderActivationDynamicModel.png

The quality of match between the second order model and the experimental data
can be improved by having separate time constants for rising
(\f$\dot{a} > 0\f$) and falling (\f$\dot{a} < 0\f$). This small change can
be easily encorporated into a canonical second order ODE of a damped system
with a forced input where \f$a\f$ is activation, \f$\zeta\f$ is damping,
\f$\omega\f$ is the natural frequency of the system, \f$\mu\f$ is excitation
(bounded by 0 and 1).

\f[
\ddot{a} + 2 \zeta \omega \dot{a} + \omega^2 a = \omega^2\mu
\f]

For a critically damped system \f$\zeta = 1\f$. To obtain a quicker rate of
decay a the value of \f$\omega\f$ changes depending on the sign of
\f$\dot{a}\f$:

if \f$\dot{a}>0\f$
\f[
    \omega = \frac{1}{T}
\f]

else if \f$\dot{a}<0\f$

\f[
    \omega = \frac{2}{T}
\f]

where \f$ T \f$ is the contraction time of the muscle. Values of \f$ T \f$ vary
from muscle to muscle, depending mainly on their fiber composition.

Although the above second order system approximates the twitch response of
muscle very well, it has a lower bound of 0. The conventional muscle model
formulation requires that activation smoothly approach a lower bound that is
above zero. This can be achieved by rescaling activation, and the lower
bound:

\f[
    \hat{a} = \frac{a}{1-a_{min}}
\f]
\f[
    \hat{a}_{min} = \frac{a_{min}}{1-a_{min}}
\f]

Subsituting in the rescaled activation and lower bound into the
second order system yields

\f[
   \ddot{a}+2\zeta\omega\dot{a}+\omega^2(\hat{a}-\hat{a}_{min})=\omega^2\mu
\f]

This is the activation dynamic equation that this class implements as it
matches Bellmare et al.'s experimental data quite well, and has a
user-settable lower bound.

<B>Default</B>


The default time to peak (or twitchTimeConstant) is 0.050 seconds. This is
on the faster end of skeletal muscles. Bellare et al. reported values of
0.0657, 0.071 and 0.116 for the biceps brachaii, adductor pollicus, and the
solues respectively.
