  Note that this object should be updated through the set methods provided.
 These set methods will take care of rebuilding the curve correctly. If you
 modify the properties directly, the curve will not be rebuilt, and upon
 calling a function like calcValue, calcDerivative, or printCurveToCSVFile
 an exception will be thrown because the curve is out of date with its

     Details to appear in Millard et al. 2012.

        @param normLengthAtZeroForce
                The normalized fiber length at which the compressive element
                begins to engage. Normalized length is defined as
                length_norm = l/l0, where l is the length of the fiber,
                and l0 is the resting length of the fiber.

        @param stiffnessAtZeroLength
                This is the stiffness of the compressive elastic force length
                spring when the fiber reaches a normalized length of 0.

        @param curviness
                A dimensionless parameter between [0-1] that controls how
                the curve is drawn: 0 will create a curve that is
                very close to a straight line segment while a value of 1 will
                create a curve that smoothly fills the corner formed by the
                linear extrapolation of 'stiffnessAtZeroLength' and the
                x axis as shown in the figure.

        @param muscleName
                The name of the muscle this curve belongs to. This name is used
                to create the name of this curve, which is formed simply by
                appending "_FiberCompressiveForceLengthCurve" to the string in
                muscleName. This name is used for making intelligible error
                messages and also for naming the XML version of this curve when
                it is serialized.
