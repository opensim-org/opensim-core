/** This class serves as a serializable ForceVelocityCurve for use in muscle
    models. The force-velocity curve is dimensionless: force is normalized to
    maximum isometric force and velocity is normalized to the maximum muscle
    contraction velocity (vmax), where vmax is expressed in units of
    optimal_fiber_lengths per second. Negative normalized velocities correspond
    to concentric contraction (i.e., shortening). The force-velocity curve is
    constructed from 8 properties:

    @param concentricSlopeAtVmax
        The slope of the force-velocity curve at a normalized velocity of -1,
        which is the minimum slope of the concentric side of the force-velocity
        curve. A physiologically accurate value for this paramter is 0, though
        values greater than 0 are necessary when the force-velocity curve must
        be inverted.
    @param concentricSlopeNearVmax
        The slope of the force-velocity curve near the maximum normalized
        concentric (shortening) contraction velocity (between approximately -0.8
        and -1).
    @param isometricSlope
        The slope of the force-velocity curve at a normalized velocity of 0,
        which is the maximum slope of the force-velocity curve. A
        physiologically accurate value for this parameter is 5 (according to
        Leiber, page 55), which is the default value. Although this parameter
        can be changed, it must be positive and greater than
        max( (maxEccentricMultiplier-1)/1, 1). The value of this parameter also
        affects how much the eccentric and concentric curves can be bent by the
        'eccentricCurviness' and 'concentricCurviness' parameters, as it places
        an upper limit on the maximum slope of the force-velocity curve.
    @param eccentricSlopeAtVmax
        The slope of the force-velocity curve at a normalized velocity of 1,
        which is the minimum slope of the eccentric side of the force-velocity
        curve.
    @param eccentricSlopeNearVmax
        The slope of the force-velocity curve near the maximum normalized
        eccentric (lengthening) contraction velocity (between approximately 0.8
        and 1).
    @param maxEccentricVelocityForceMultiplier
        The value of the force-velocity curve (i.e., the force-velocity
        multiplier) at the maximum eccentric contraction velocity.
        Physiologically acccurate values for this parameter range between 1.1
        and 1.8, and may vary between subjects.
    @param concentricCurviness
        A dimensionless parameter between 0 and 1 that describes the shape of
        the concentric curve: a value of 0 indicates that the curve is very
        close to a straight line segment and a value of 1 indicates a curve that
        smoothly fills the corner formed by the linear extrapolation of
        'concentricSlopeNearVmax' and 'isometricSlope', as shown in the figure.
    @param eccentricCurviness
        A dimensionless parameter between 0 and 1 that describes the shape of
        the eccentric curve: a value of 0 indicates that the curve is very close
        to a straight line segment and a value of 1 indicates a curve that
        smoothly fills the corner formed by the linear extrapolation of
        'isometricSlope' and 'eccentricSlopeNearVmax', as shown in the figure.

    Note that this object should be updated through the set methods provided.
    These set methods will take care of rebuilding the curve correctly. If you
    modify the properties directly, the curve will not be rebuilt, and upon
    calling a function like calcValue, calcDerivative, or printCurveToCSVFile,
    an exception will be thrown because the curve is out-of-date with its
    properties.
