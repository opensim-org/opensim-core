/**
 This class serves as a serializable FiberCompressiveForceCosPennationCurve,
 which is used to ensure that the pennation angle approaches but never reaches
 an angle of 90 degrees. Preventing the fibers from achivieving a pennation
 angle of 90 degrees is important for equilibrium muscle models which
 have a singularity at this value.

 This curve is designed to work with the muscle model
 in such a way that it acts like a spring that the pennated muscle fibers
 contact it as the fiber rotates (circuled in red). When the spring engages it
 will exert a force on the fiber that will prevent it from shortening further,
 thus preventing the pennation angle from reaching 90 degrees.

 Note that this object should be updated through the set methods provided.
 These set methods will take care of rebuilding the curve correctly. If you
 modify the properties directly, the curve will not be rebuilt, and upon
 calling a function like calcValue, calcDerivative, or printCurveToCSVFile
 an exception will be thrown because the curve is out of date with its
 properties.

    /**
     Constructs a C2 continuous compressive fiber force cos pennation curve. The
     sole purpose of this curve is to prevent the pennation angle from reaching
     an angle of 90 degrees. Details to appear in Millard et al. 2012.

        @param engagementAngleInDegrees
                The pennation angle engagement angle of the fiber compressive
                force pennation curve. Making the spring engage too
                far from 90 degrees may unrealistically limit the force
                production capability of the muscle. An engagement angle of
                80 degrees is a good place to start.

        @param stiffnessAtPerpendicular
                This is the stiffness of the compressive elastic force length
                spring when the pennation angle reaches 90 degrees. Note that
                the units of this stiffness are
                (normalized force) / cos(engagmentAngleInDegrees). If the
                engagement angle is 80 degrees, a good stiffness to start with
                is -2*(1/cosd(engagementAngleInDegrees))

        @param curviness
                A dimensionless parameter between [0-1] that controls how
                the curve is drawn: 0 will create a curve that is
                very close to a straight line segment while a value of 1 will
                create a curve that smoothly fills the corner formed by the
                linear extrapolation of 'stiffnessAtPerpendicularFiber' and the
                x axis as shown in the figure. A good curviness parameter value
                to start with is 0.5.

        @param muscleName
                The name of the muscle this curve belongs to. This name is used
                to create the name of this curve, which is formed simply by
                appending "_FiberCompressiveForceCosPennationCurve" to the
                string in muscleName. This name is used for making intelligible
                error messages and also for naming the XML version of this curve
                when it is serialized.
