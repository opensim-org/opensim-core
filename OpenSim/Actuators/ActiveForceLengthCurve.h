/** This class serves as a serializable ActiveForceLengthCurve, commonly used
    to model the active element in muscle models. The active-force-length curve
    is dimensionless: force is normalized to maximum isometric force and length
    is normalized to resting fiber length. Five properties are used to construct
    a curve:

    @param minActiveNormFiberLength
        The normalized fiber length where the steep ascending limb of the
        active-force-length curve transitions to the minimum value and has first
        and second derivatives of 0.
    @param transitionNormFiberLength
        The normalized fiber length where the steep ascending limb transitions
        to the shallow ascending limb.
    @param maxActiveNormFiberLength
        The normalized fiber length where the descending limb transitions to the
        minimum value and has first and second derivatives of 0.
    @param shallowAscendingSlope
        The slope of the shallow ascending limb.
    @param minimumValue
        The minimum value of the active-force-length curve. If you are using an
        equilibrium model, this value must be greater than 0, as a value of 0
        will cause a singularity in the muscle dynamic equations.

    \image html fig_ActiveForceLengthCurve.png

    <B>Conditions</B>
    \verbatim
    0 < minActiveNormFiberLength < transitionNormFiberLength < 1 < maxActiveNormFiberLength
    0 <= shallowAscendingSlope < 1/(1-transitionNormFiberLength)
    0 <= minimumValue
    \endverbatim

    <B>Default Parameter Values</B>
    The default parameters have been chosen so that the resulting curve closely
    matches the active-force-length curve for human sarcomeres, as documented by
    Nigg and Herzog (1994). The descending limb has been adjusted to match the
    in-vitro human fiber data reported by Gollapudi and Lin (2009). The default
    shoulder value is set to 0.1. This relatively large value is used to ensure
    that muscle model dynamic equations with an active-force-length singularity
    do not take an unreasonable amount of time to simulate (simulation time
    grows as the value of the active-force-length curve approaches 0). %Muscle
    model formulations that do not have this singularity (e.g., the
    Millard2012AccelerationMuscle model) can use a minimumValue of 0.

    \verbatim
    minActiveNormFiberLength ..... 0.4441
    transitionNormFiberLength .... 0.73
    maxActiveNormFiberLength ..... 1.8123
    shallowAscendingSlope ........ 0.8616
    minimumValue ................. 0.1
    \endverbatim

    <B>Example</B>
    @code
    ActiveForceLengthCurve falCurve1(0.44, 0.73, 1.8, 0.86, 0.1);
    double falVal  = falCurve1.calcValue(1.0);
    double dfalVal = falCurve1.calcDerivative(1.0, 1);
    @endcode

    Note that this object should be updated through the set methods provided.
    These set methods will take care of rebuilding the curve correctly. If you
    modify the properties directly, the curve will not be rebuilt, and upon
    calling a function like calcValue, calcDerivative, or printCurveToCSVFile,
    an exception will be thrown because the curve is out-of-date with its
    properties.
