/** This class serves as a serializable FiberForceLengthCurve, commonly used to
    model the parallel elastic element in muscle models. The fiber-force-length
    curve is dimensionless: force is normalized to maximum isometric force and
    length is normalized to resting fiber length. The user can adjust the
    maximum strain at no load and the strain developed under 1 normalized unit
    of force using the fitted curve. Additionally, if desired, it is possible to
    directly set the low-force stiffness of the fiber, the stiffness of the
    fiber at 1 normalized unit of force, and the shape of the curve (its
    'curviness'):

    <h3>Properties</h3>
    - \c strainAtZeroForce<br>
        The fiber strain at which the fiber starts to develop force.
        strainAtZeroForce = 0.0 means that the fiber will begin developing
        tension when it is at its resting length.

    - \c strainAtOneNormForce<br>
        The fiber strain at which the fiber develops 1 unit of normalized force.
        strainAtOneNormForce = 0.6 means that the fiber will develop a tension
        of 1 normalized force when it is strained by 60% of its resting length
        or, equivalently, when it is stretched to 1.6 times its resting length.

    - \c stiffnessAtLowForce<br>
        The normalized stiffness (slope of the curve) when the fiber is just
        beginning to develop tensile force.

    - \c stiffnessAtOneNormForce<br>
        The normalized stiffness (slope of the curve) when the fiber develops a
        tension of 1 normalized unit of force.

    - \c curviness<br>
        A dimensionless parameter between 0 and 1 that describes the shape of
        the curve: a value of 0 indicates a curve that is very close to a
        straight line segment and a value of 1 indicates a curve that smoothly
        fills the corner formed by the linear extrapolation of
        'stiffnessAtOneNormForce' and the x-axis, as shown in the figure.

    Note that we use the Cauchy or engineering definition of strain throughout:
    strain = (l-l0)/l0, where l is the current fiber length and l0 is its
    resting length.

    <h3>Required Properties</h3>
    - \c strainAtZeroForce
    - \c strainAtOneNormForce

    <h3>Optional Properties</h3>
    - \c stiffnessAtLowForce
    - \c stiffnessAtOneNormForce
    - \c curviness

    \image html fig_FiberForceLengthCurve.png

    <h3>Conditions</h3>
    \verbatim
    strainAtZeroForce < strainAtOneNormForce
    stiffnessAtOneNormForce > 1/(strainAtOneNormForce-strainAtZeroForce)
    0 < stiffnessAtLowForce < stiffnessAtOneNormForce
    0 <= curviness <= 1
    \endverbatim

    The required parameters can be set using either the constructor or the
    setCurveStrains function; the optional parameters can be set using the
    setOptionalProperties function. Note that filling in one optional parameter
    but not the others will throw an exception when the curve is built. The
    optional parameters can be used to vary the shape of the curve from a close
    approximation of a line to a sharply-bent curve.
    
    The advantage of this curve over the typical exponential curve used in the
    literature is that it is continuous to the second derivative; the usual
    linearly-extrapolated exponential curve is only C0-continuous. The improved
    smoothness of this curve makes the equations somewhat easier to simulate
    and, more importantly, permits the use of derivative-based numerical methods
    on the curve. In addition, the extra parameters in this curve formulation
    can be adjusted to match a wide variety of shapes, should it be desired to
    fit the curve to a different set of experimental data.

    <h3>Default Parameter Values</h3>
    If the optional parameters are not specified, the curve is fit to the
    experimentally measured fiber-force-length curves of Winters et al. (2010,
    Fig. 3a).

    \verbatim
    strainAtZeroForce .......... 0.0
    strainAtOneNormForce ....... 0.7
    stiffnessAtLowForce ........ 0.2
    stiffnessAtOneNormForce .... 2.0 / (strainAtOneNormForce-strainAtZeroForce) = 2.86
    curviness .................. 0.75
    \endverbatim

    <h3>Example</h3>
    @code
    // Make a fitted fiber-force-length curve.
    FiberForceLengthCurve fpeCurve1;
    fpeCurve1.setCurveStrains(0.0, 0.7);
    double fpeVal1 = fpeCurve1.calcValue(0.1);

    // Make a custom fiber-force-length curve by supplying all parameters.
    FiberForceLengthCurve fpeCurve2(0.0, 0.7, 0.2, 2.86, 0.75);
    double fpeVal2  = fpeCurve2.calcValue(0.02);
    double dfpeVal2 = fpeCurve2.calcDerivative(0.02, 1);
    @endcode

    Note that this object should be updated through the set methods provided.
    These set methods will take care of rebuilding the curve correctly. If you
    modify the properties directly, the curve will not be rebuilt, and upon
    calling a function like calcValue, calcDerivative, or printCurveToCSVFile,
    an exception will be thrown because the curve is out-of-date with its
    properties.
