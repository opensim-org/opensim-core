/** This class serves as a serializable TendonForceLengthCurve for use in muscle
    models. The tendon-force-length curve is dimensionless: force is normalized
    to maximum isometric force and length is normalized to tendon slack length.
    The user can adjust the strain the tendon undergoes at 1 unit load (e0), its
    stiffness at a strain of e0, and the shape of the tendon curve (its
    'curviness'):

    @param strainAtOneNormForce
        The tendon strain at which the tendon develops 1 unit of normalized
        force. strainAtOneNormForce = 0.04 means that the tendon will develop a
        tension of 1 normalized force when it is strained by 4% of its slack
        length or, equivalently, is stretched to 1.04 times its resting length.
    @param stiffnessAtOneNormForce
        The normalized stiffness (slope of the tendon curve) when the tendon is
        strained by strainAtOneNormForce under a load of 1 normalized unit of
        force.
    @param normForceAtToeEnd
        The normalized force developed at the end of the 'toe' region. The toe
        region lies between 0 strain and some intermediate strain less than the
        strain required to develop 1 unit of normalized force. The toe region is
        nonlinear and more compliant than the rest of the tendon curve.
    @param curviness
        A dimensionless parameter between 0 and 1 that describes the shape of
        the curve: a value of 0 indicates that the curve is very close to a
        straight line segment and a value of 1 indicates a curve that smoothly
        fills the corner formed by the linear extrapolation of
        'stiffnessAtOneNormForce' and the x-axis, as shown in the figure.

    Note that we use the Cauchy or engineering definition of strain throughout:
    strain = (l-l0)/l0, where l is the current tendon length and l0 is its slack
    length.

    <B>Required Parameters</B>
    \li strainAtOneNormForce

    <B>Optional Parameters</B>
    \li stiffnessAtOneNormForce
    \li normForceAtToeEnd
    \li curviness

    \image html fig_TendonForceLengthCurve.png

    <B>Conditions</B>
    \verbatim
    strainAtOneNormForce > 0
    stiffnessAtOneNormForce > 1/strainAtOneNormForce
    0 < normForceAtToeEnd < 1
    0 <= curviness <= 1
    \endverbatim

    All parameters but the strain of the tendon at 1 unit load (e0) are
    optional. Note that filling in one optional parameter but not the others
    will throw an exception when the curve is built. The optional parameters can
    be used to vary the shape of the curve from a close approximation of a line
    to a sharply-bent curve.

    This curve has the advantage of being C2-continuous, which results in faster
    simulations when compared to the popular method of using a linearly
    extrapolated exponential (C0-continuous) curve to parameterize the
    tendon-force-length relationship. See Millard et al. (2013) for details.

    <B>Default Parameter Values</B>
    If the optional parameters are not specified, the curve is fit to match the
    average dimensionless in-vivo tendon curve reported by Maganarius et al. and
    Magnusson et al. In addition, the generated curve will have a characteristic
    toe region that is fit to the in-vivo literature. Note that this curve is
    not being fit to the commonly used linearly extrapolated exponential curve
    documented by Thelen, as it makes the toe region about half as stiff as both
    the in-vitro and in-vivo data indicate is reasonable. Additionally, the
    linear section of the curve would be nearly twice as stiff as the data
    indicates is reasonable.

    \verbatim
    strainAtOneNormForce ....... 0.049
    stiffnessAtOneNormForce .... 1.375/strainAtOneNormForce
    normForceAtToeEnd .......... 2.0/3.0
    curviness .................. 0.5
    \endverbatim

    <B>Example</B>
    @code
        TendonForceLengthCurve fseCurve(0.049, 28.1, 0.67, 0.5);
        double fseVal   = fseCurve.calcValue(0.02);
        double dfselVal = fseCurve.calcDerivative(0.02, 1);
    @endcode

    Note that this object should be updated through the set methods provided.
    These set methods will take care of rebuilding the curve correctly. If you
    modify the properties directly, the curve will not be rebuilt, and upon
    calling a function like calcValue, calcDerivative, or printCurveToCSVFile,
    an exception will be thrown because the curve is out-of-date with its
    properties.
