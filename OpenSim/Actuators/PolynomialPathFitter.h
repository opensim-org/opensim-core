/**
 * A utility class for fitting a set of `FunctionBasedPath`s to existing
 * geometry-path in an OpenSim model using `MultivariatePolynomialFunction`s.
 *
 * The primary inputs to this class include a model containing path objects
 * derived from `AbstractGeometryPath` (e.g., `GeometryPath`) and a reference
 * trajectory containing coordinate values for all `Coordinate`s in the model.
 * The path fitting process samples coordinate values around the reference
 * trajectory, computes path lengths and moment arms from the geometry-based
 * paths in the model, and fits polynomial coefficients for
 * `MultivariatePolynomialFunction` objects based on the path length and moment
 * arm samples. The fitted paths are written to an XML file, along with the
 * modified coordinate values, sampled coordinate values, path lengths, and
 * moment arms for both the original and fitted paths.
 *
 * @note Each file name is prefixed with the name of the model, and the
 *       directory to which the results are written can be specified using the
 *      `setOutputDirectory` method.
 *
 * Settings
 * --------
 * Various settings can be adjusted to control the path fitting process. The
 * `setMomentArmsThreshold` method determines whether or not a path depends on a
 * model coordinate. In other words, the absolute value the moment arm of a with
 * respect to a particular coordinate must be greater than this value to be
 * included during path fitting. The `setMinimumPolynomialOrder` and
 * `setMaximumPolynomialOrder` methods specify the minimum and maximum order of
 * the polynomial used to fit each path. The `setGlobalCoordinateSamplingBounds`
 * property specifies the global bounds (in degrees) that determine the minimum
 * and maximum coordinate values sampled at each time point. The method
 * `appendCoordinateSamplingBounds` can be used to override the global bounds
 * for a specific coordinate. The `setMomentArmTolerance` and
 * `setPathLengthTolerance` methods specify the tolerance on the
 * root-mean-square (RMS) error (in meters) between the moment arms and path
 * lengths computed from the original model paths and the fitted polynomial
 * paths. The `setNumSamplesPerFrame` method specifies the number of samples
 * taken per time frame in the coordinate values table used to fit each path.
 * The `setParallel` method specifies the number of threads used to parallelize
 * the path fitting process. The `setLatinHypercubeAlgorithm` method specifies
 * the Latin hypercube sampling algorithm used to sample coordinate values for
 * path fitting.
 *
 * The default settings are as follows:
 *
 *    - Moment arm threshold: 1e-3 meters
 *    - Minimum polynomial order: 2
 *    - Maximum polynomial order: 6
 *    - Global coordinate sampling bounds: [-10, 10] degrees
 *    - Moment arm tolerance: 1e-4 meters
 *    - Path length tolerance: 1e-4 meters
 *    - Number of samples per frame: 25
 *    - Number of threads: (# of available hardware threads) - 2
 *    - Latin hypercube sampling algorithm: "random"
 *
 * @note The default settings were chosen based on testing with a human
 *       lower-extremity model. Different settings may be required for other
 *       models with larger or smaller anatomical measures (e.g., dinosaur
 *       models).
 *
 * Usage
 * -----
 * The most basic usage of `PolynomialPathFitter` requires the user to provide
 * a model and reference trajectory. The model should contain at least one path
 * object derived from `AbstractGeometryPath` and should not contain any
 * `FunctionBasedPath` objects. The reference trajectory must contain coordinate
 * values for all `Coordinate`s in the model:
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * PolynomialPathFitter fitter;
 * fitter.setModel(ModelProcessor("model.osim"));
 * fitter.setCoordinateValues(TableProcessor("values.sto"));
 * @endcode
 *
 * The additional settings can be adjusted using the various `set` methods
 * described above. For example, the global coordinate sampling bounds, bounds
 * for the coordinate at "/jointset/slider/position", and the number of samples
 * per frame can be set as follows:
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * fitter.setGlobalCoordinateSamplingBounds(SimTK::Vec2(-20.0, 20.0));
 * fitter.appendCoordinateSamplingBounds(
 *         "/jointset/slider/position", SimTK::Vec2(-5.0, 15.0));
 * fitter.setNumSamplesPerFrame(50);
 * @endcode
 *
 * The path fitting process can be run using the `run()` method:
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * fitter.run();
 * @endcode
 *
 * Recommendations
 * ---------------
 * Information from each step of the path fitting process is logged to the
 * console, provided that you have set the OpenSim::Logger to level "info" or
 * greater. Warnings are printed if the number of samples is likely insufficient
 * for the fitting process, or if the fit for a particular path did not meet the
 * specified tolerances.
 *
 * It is highly recommended to use the files printed to the output directory to
 * evaluate the quality of the fitted paths (see `setOutputDirectory()` for more
 * details). Depending on the quality of the original model, it may not be
 * possible to achieve a good fit for all paths (e.g., due to kinks or other
 * discontinuities in the path). Finally, the fitted paths should only be used
 * in simulations for which the coordinate values represent the expected range
 * of motion for the model. If you are unsure if a simulation you have created
 * with the fitted paths is valid, you can use the `evaluateFunctionBasedPaths`
 * static method to compare the fitted paths to the original model paths given a
 * new kinematic trajectory.
 *
 * @note The `evaluateFunctionBasedPaths` method can be used independently from
 *       the rest of this class, and does not require the `FunctionBasedPath`s
 *       in the model to use `MultivariatePolynomialFunction`s.

     *
     *     1. Load the model and reference coordinate values trajectory. The
     *        coordinate values table is modified to update the column labels
     *        based on the model coordinate paths, to update any coordinates
     *        dependent on `CoordinateCouplerConstraint`s, and to convert the
     *        coordinate values to radians if the "inDegrees" metadata flag is
     *        set to "yes".
     *
     *     2. Set sampling bounds for coordinates based on the global and
     *        coordinate-specific bounds properties.
     *
     *     3. Verify that the remaining user settings are valid.
     *
     *     4. Sample coordinate values around the reference trajectory using
     *        Latin hypercube sampling. The sampling is defined based on the
     *        coordinate bounds and range maps, the number of samples per frame,
     *        and the Latin hypercube sampling algorithm.
     *
     *     5. Compute path lengths and moment arms from the geometry-based paths
     *        in the input model.
     *
     *     6. Filter out bad coordinate samples and populate a map containing
     *        the coordinates that path is dependent on.
     *
     *     7. Fit the polynomial coefficients by finding a least-squares fit
     *        between the path lengths and moment arms computed from the
     *        geometry-based paths and the path lengths and moment arms
     *        computed from the fitted polynomial-based paths.
     *
     *     8. Print out a summary of the path fitting results, including
     *        information about the fitted polynomial functions and
     *        root-mean-square (RMS) errors between the original and fitted
     *        paths.
     *
     *     9. Write the fitted paths, modified coordinate values, sampled
     *        coordinate values, path lengths, and moment arms to files.
