/**
 * A Computed Muscle Control (CMC) optimization target for controlling 
 * dynamic systems whose actuators may be themselves governed by differential
 * equations, meaning there may be non-linear behavior and delays in force
 * production.
 *
 * The performance criterion is a sum of two terms.  The first term
 * is the sum of actutor stresses squared.  The second term is a weighted
 * sum of terms designed to achieve a set of desired accelerations that
 * will drive the dynamic model toward a set of target kinematic trajectories.
 * The desired accelerations are according to the Proportional Derivative (PD)
 * control law.
 *
 * Because the performance criterion is simply a long sum of things,
 * achieving the desired accelerations can be compromised in order to
 * reduce the forces (or moments) applied by the actutors.  This feature
 * is what is exploited by the Residual Reduction Algorithm.
 *
 * Although this target is fairly robust (meaning the optimizer should not
 * fail to find a solution), it is a bit slower and less accurate than
 * the "fast" target @see ActuatorForceTargetFast.
 * 
 * @version 1.0
