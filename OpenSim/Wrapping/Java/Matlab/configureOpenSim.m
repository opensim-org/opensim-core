 function configureOpenSim
%% configureOpenSim() adds OpenSim library paths to MATLAB path files
%    Allows user to select the location of the OpenSim install directory
%    and add these paths to the matlab library paths. Will allow MATLAB
%    users to run OpenSim calls in Matlab.
%    Build Data: 10.17.2013
%    Tested with Matlab 2012a and OpenSim 3.1 on Windows 7
