% Test program to load muscles and change strength of muscles and re-save
% model
%
% Inputs - scaleFactor (double) - amount to scale all muscle forces
%          Model_In (string) - existing model path and file name
%          Model_Out (string) - new model path and file name
%
% eg. strengthScaler(2)
% eg. strengthScaler(2, 'mySimpleBlockModel.osim')
% eg. strengthScaler(2, 'mySimpleBlockModel.osim', 'myStrongerBlockModel.osim')
