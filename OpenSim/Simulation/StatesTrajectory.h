namespace SimTK {
class State;

namespace OpenSim {

class Storage;
class Model;

// Design note: This class is part of OpenSim instead of Simbody since Simbody
// users are likely to be interested in a more general State container that
// doesn't assume the states are sequential in time.

// TODO See the bottom of this file for a class description to use once the
// OSTATES file format is implemented.
//
/** This class holds a sequence of SimTK::State%s. You can obtain a
 * StatesTrajectory during a simulation via the StatesTrajectoryReporter. You
 * can also create a StatesTrajectory from a states storage (.sto) file (see
 * createFromStatesStorage()). Users can modify a trajectory by appending
 * states to it, but users cannot modify the individual states that are already
 * in a trajectory.
 *
 * This class was introduced in OpenSim version 4.0, and enables scripting
 * (Python/MATLAB) and C++ users to postprocess their results with greater ease
 * and flexibility than with an Analysis.
 *
 * @note In a future release, we plan to support an OSTATES file format that
 * allows one to write the trajectory to a file with full numerical precision.
 *
 * ### Guarantees
 * This class is designed to ensure the following:
 * - The states are ordered nondecreasing in time (adjacent states *can* have
 *   the same time).
 * - All states in the trajectory are consistent with each other (see
 *   isConsistent()).
 *
 * @note These guarantees apply when using this class through C++, Java,
 * or the %OpenSim GUI, but **not** through Python or MATLAB. This is because
 * Python and MATLAB do not enforce constness and thus allow modifying the
 * trajectory.
 *
 * ### Using with a %Model 
 * A StatesTrajectory is not very useful on its own, since neither the
 * trajectory nor the contained states know how the Component%s name the state
 * variables they create. You probably want to use the trajectory with an
 * OpenSim::Model, through which the state variables have a meaning (e.g.,
 * `model.getStateVariableValue(states[0], "soleus_r/activation")`).
 *
 * SimTK::State%s have a tight association with a specific OpenSim::Model
 * (actually, with the SimTK::System within an OpenSim::Model). However,
 * the StatesTrajectory does not know anything about the model to which
 * it corresponds. So, for example, you could use a single StatesTrajectory
 * with a generic gait2392 model as well as with a scaled (subject-specific)
 * gait2392 model. This flexibility may be beneficial in some scenarios, but
 * also allows one to accidentally use the wrong model with a given states
 * trajectory, potentially leading to silent errors that could compromise a
 * scientific study.
 *
 * To increase your confidence that a StatesTrajectory matches a given Model,
 * you can perform some weak checks with isCompatibleWith().
 *
 * ### Usage
 * Here are a few basic things you can do with a StatesTrajectory, assuming you
 * already have one:
 * @code{.cpp}
 * StatesTrajectory states = getStatesTrajectorySomehow();
 * const double numStates = states.getSize();
 * const double initialTime = states[0].getTime();
 * const double finalTime = states.back().getTime();
 * @endcode
 *
 * Without a model, you can access the state variable values, but you won't
 * know the identity of such state variables.
 * @code{.cpp}
 * int numGeneralizedCoordinates = states[0].getNQ();
 * const SimTK::Vector& generalizedCoordinateValues = states[0].getQ();
 * @endcode
 *
 * To do most things with the StatesTrajectory, you'll need a model as well as
 * its underlying SimTK::System. **It is therefore required that you call
 * `Model::initSystem()` before you try to use any states with the model**:
 * @code{.cpp}
 * Model model("subject01.osim");
 * model.initSystem();
 * double knee_angle = model.getStateVariableValue(states[0], "knee/flexion/value");
 * Vec3 com = model.calcMassCenterPosition(states[0]);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Depending on the quantity you want to obtain, you may also need to realize
 * the state to a certain stage:
 * @code{.cpp}
 * model.getMultibodySystem().realize(states[0], SimTK::Stage::Velocity);
 * model.getMuscles().get("soleus_r").getActivation(states[0]);
 * @endcode
 *
 * You can iterate through a trajectory to access the value of a state variable
 * at each time in the trajectory.
 * @code{.cpp}
 * for (const auto& state : states) {
 *     std::cout << state.getTime() << " "
 *               << model.getStateVariableValue(state, "knee/flexion/value")
 *               << std::endl;
 * }
 * @endcode

// TODO The following class description should be revisited when support for
// OSTATES files is completed.
/* This class holds a sequence of SimTK::State%s that can be saved to a
 * plain-text OSTATES file.  The trajectory can also be populated from such a
 * file. You may obtain a StatesTrajectory from a simulation, or other
 * numerical methods whose task is to produce a trajectory of states. Users can
 * modify the trajectory by appending states to it, but users cannot modify the
 * individual states that are already in the trajectory.
 *
 * This class was introduced in OpenSim version 4.0, and enables scripting
 * (Python/MATLAB) and C++ users to postprocess their results with greater ease
 * and more versatility than with an Analysis.
 *
 * @note This class is a work in progress. The ability to read and write a
 * StatesTrajectory to an OSTATES is not available yet, even though the
 * documentation is written as if this ability exists.
 *
 * ### Guarantees
 * This class is designed to ensure the following:
 * - The states are ordered nondecreasing in time (adjacent states *can* have
 *   the same time).
 * - All states in the trajectory are consistent with each other (see
 *   isConsistent()).
 *
 * @note These guarantees apply when using this class through C++, Java,
 * or the %OpenSim GUI, but **not** through Python or MATLAB. This is because
 * Python and MATLAB do not enforce constness and thus allow modifying the
 * trajectory.
 *
 * ### File format
 * StatesTrajectory files use the file extension `.ostates`, with the XML
 * format. Therefore, you could theoretically edit a StatesTrajectory file in
 * a typical text editing program, or in Python/MATLAB using XML libraries
 * (such a process is is likely to be painful; consider using the
 * createFromStatesStorage() utility instead).
 *
 * A SimTK::State object contains many different types of data, but only some
 * are saved into the OSTATES file:
 * 
 * type of data                 | saved in OSTATES?
 * ---------------------------- | -----------------
 * (continuous) state variables | yes
 * discrete state variables     | yes
 * modeling options             | yes
 * cache variables              | no
 *
 * The cache variables (e.g., total system mass, control signals) are not saved
 * to the OSTATES file because they can be computed from the state variables
 * and are not necessary for describing the state of the system (see
 * Component::addStateVariable).
 *
 * %OpenSim Object%s (Model OSIM files, Tool setup files) also use an
 * XML format, but that format is *completely unrelated* to the XML format used
 * for OSTATES files.
