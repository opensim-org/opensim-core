/**
* A `ForceConsumer` is an abstract class that can consume forces via its `consume*`
* methods. It is typically used in conjunction with `ForceProducer`s, which produce
* the forces that this API consumes.
*
* The `ForceConsumer` API does not dictate how concrete implementations should
* handle the forces. This is to support several use-cases (examples):
*
* - Implementations that actually apply the forces (see: `ForceProducer::computeForce`, `ForceApplier`),
* - Implementations that print force debugging information
* - Implementations that want to render force vectors in 3D (e.g. UIs)
