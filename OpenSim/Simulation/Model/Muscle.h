 * A base class for modeling a muscle-tendon actuator. It defines muscle parameters

 * in PathActuator, and the force-generating behavior should be defined in
 * the derived classes.
 *
 * This class defines a subset of muscle models that include an active fiber
 * (contractile element) in series with a tendon. This class defines common 
 * data members and handles the geometry of a unipennate fiber in connection
 * with a tendon. No states are assumed, but concrete classes are free to
 * add whatever states are necessary to describe the specific behavior of a
 * muscle.

    [1] fiberLengthAlongTendon is the length of the muscle fiber as projected
        on the tendon.

    [2] normFiberLength is the fiberLength normalized with respect to the 
        optimalFiberLength, 

        normFiberLength = fiberLength / optimalFiberLength

        N.B. It is assumed that the optimalFiberLength of a muscle is also 
        its resting length. 
    
    [3] normTendonLength is the tendonLength normalized with respect to the 
        tendonSlackLength

        normTendonLength = tendonLength / tendonSlackLength

    [4] Tendon strain is defined using the elongation of the material divided by 
        its resting length. This is identical to the engineering definition of
        strain. Thus a tendonStrain of 0.01 means that the tendon is currently
        1% longer than its resting length.

        tendonStrain = (tendonLength-tendonSlackLength)/tendonSlackLength
        

    [5] The orientation of the muscle fiber is defined w.r.t. a fixed 
        orientation of the tendon. A pennation angle of 0 means that the fiber 
        is collinear to the tendon. It is normal for the pennation angle
        to range between 0 and Pi/2 radians.

    [6] The fiberPassiveForceLengthMultiplier represents the elastic force the fiber 
        generates normalized w.r.t. the maximum isometric force of the fiber.
        Is typically specified by a passiveForceLengthCurve. 
        

    [7] The fiberActiveForceLengthMultiplier is the scaling of the maximum force a fiber 
        can generate as a function of its length. This term usually follows a 
        curve that is zero at a normalized fiber length of 0.5, is 1 at a 
        normalized fiber length of 1, and then zero again at a normalized fiber
        length of 1.5. This curve is generally an interpolation of experimental
        data.

    [8] This vector is left for the muscle modeler to populate with any
        computationally expensive quantities that are computed in 
        calcMuscleLengthInfo, and required for use in the user defined functions 
        calcFiberVelocityInfo and calcMuscleDynamicsInfo. None of the parent 
        classes make any assumptions about what is or isn't in this field 
        - use as necessary.

        [1] fiberVelocityAlongTendon is the first derivative of the symbolic
            equation that defines the fiberLengthAlongTendon.

        [2] normFiberVelocity is the fiberVelocity normalized with respect to 
            the optimal fiber length of the fiber and the maximum fiber velocity
            defined in fiber-lengths/s.

        [3] The sign of the angular velocity is defined using the right 
            hand rule.

        [4] normTendonVelocity is the tendonVelocity (the lengthening velocity 
            of the tendon) divided by its resting length

        [5] The fiberForceVelocityMultiplier is the scaling factor that represents
            how a muscle fiber's force generating capacity is modulated by the
            contraction (concentric or eccentric) velocity of the fiber.
            Generally this curve has a value of 1 at a fiber velocity of 0, 
            has a value of between 1.4-1.8 at the maximum eccentric contraction
            velocity and a value of 0 at the maximum concentric contraction 
            velocity. The force velocit curve, which computes this term,  
            is usually an interpolation of an experimental curve.

        [6] This vector is left for the muscle modeler to populate with any
            computationally expensive quantities that are computed in 
            calcFiberVelocityInfo, and required for use in the user defined 
            function calcMuscleDynamicsInfo. None of the parent classes make 
            any assumptions about what is or isn't in this field
            - use as necessary.

        [1] This is a quantity that ranges between 0 and 1 that dictates how
            on or activated a muscle is. This term may or may not have its own
            time dependent behaviour depending on the muscle model.

        [2] fiberForceAlongTendon is the fraction of the force that is developed
            by the fiber that is transmitted to the tendon. This fraction 
            depends on the pennation model that is used for the muscle model

        [3] This is the force developed by the fiber scaled by the maximum 
            isometric contraction force. Note that the maximum isometric force
            is defined as the maximum isometric force a muscle fiber develops
            at its optimal pennation angle, and along the line of the fiber.

        [4] This is the portion of the fiber force that is created as a direct
            consequence of the value of 'activation'.

        [5] This is the portion of the fiber force that is created by the 
            parallel elastic element within the fiber.
    
        [6] This is the tendonForce normalized by the maximum isometric 
            contraction force

        [7] fiberStiffness is defined as the partial derivative of fiber force
            with respect to fiber length

        [8] fiberStiffnessAlongTendon is defined as the partial derivative of 
            fiber force along the tendon with respect to small changes in
            the fiber length along the tendon. This quantity is normally 
            computed using the equations for fiberStiffness, and then using an 
            application of the chain rule to yield fiberStiffnessAlongTendon.

        [9] tendonStiffness is defined as the partial derivative of tendon
            force with respect to tendon length

        [10] muscleStiffness is defined as the partial derivative of muscle force
            with respect to changes in muscle length. This quantity can usually
            be computed by noting that the tendon and the fiber are in series,
            with the fiber at a pennation angle. Thus

            Kmuscle =   (Kfiber_along_tendon * Ktendon)
                       /(Kfiber_along_tendon + Ktendon) 

        [11] This vector is left for the muscle modeler to populate with any
             computationally expensive quantities that might be of interest 
             after dynamics caclulations are completed but maybe of use
             in computing muscle derivatives or reporting values of interest.
