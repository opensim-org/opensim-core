 * This class represents a Probe which is designed to query a Vector of model values
 * given system state. This model quantity is specified as a SimTK::Vector by the pure
 * virtual method computeProbeInputs(), which must be specified for each child Probe.
 * In addition, the Probe model component interface allows <I> operations </I> to be
 * performed on this value (specified by the property: probe_operation), and then have
 * this result scaled (by the scalar property: 'scale_factor').
 *
 * The data flow of the Probe is shown below:

 * The model query is performed at Stage::Report, so that model values are up to date
 * and is based on the specific Probe's overridden method computeProbeInputs(s).
 * The final output of the probe is available by accessing getProbeOutputs(s).
 * Note that all queries, operations, and scaling are performed by SimTK::Measures.
 * Note also that to define a new child Probe class, three methods which are declared
 * as pure virtual in this Probe abstract class need to be overridden:\n
 * - computeProbeInputs()     ---   returns the input probe values (i.e., model queries).
 * - getNumProbeInputs()      ---   returns the size of the vector of input probe values (i.e., model queries).
 * - getProbeOutputLabels()   ---   returns the labels that correspond to each probe value.
 *
 * <B> Available probe operations: </B>
 * - 'value' (default): returns the probe input value.
 * - 'integrate'      : returns the integral of the probe input value.
 * - 'differentiate'  : returns the derivative of the probe input value.
 * - 'minimum'        : returns the minimum of the probe input value.
 * - 'minabs'         : returns the absolute minimum of the probe input value (always positive).
 * - 'maximum'        : returns the maximum of the probe input value.
 * - 'maxabs'         : returns the absolute maximum of the probe input value (always positive).
 *
 * The Probe interface differs from the Analysis interface in two fundamental ways:
 * -  (1) Operations can be performed on probes (i.e., in addition to simply reporting
 *        a model value, model values (probe input values) may have operations performed
 *        on them such as integration and differentiation).
 *
 * -  (2) Analyses are not formally part of the model structure (i.e. they are not
 *        ModelComponents), and because of this, analysis results can not be accessed with
 *        the model and state value -- they can only be accessed by file at the end of a
 *        simulation. Probes, on the other hand, are ModelComponents and therefore can be
 *        accessed at any time during a simulation from the API, and can also be used to
 *        compute model values that are fed back into ths system through via custom designed
 *        Controllers. Note that Probe values can also be reported to file at the end of a
 *        simulation by attaching a ProbeReporter analysis to the simulation.
