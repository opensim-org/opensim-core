/**
 * A Frame is an OpenSim representation of a reference frame. It consists of
 * a right-handed set of three orthogonal axes and an origin point. Frames are
 * intended to provide convenient reference frames for locating physical
 * structures (such as joints and muscle attachments) as well as provide a
 * convenient basis for performing spatial calculations. For example, if your
 * system involves contact, you might define a Frame that is aligned with the
 * normal direction of a contact surface and whose origin is at the
 * center-of-pressure.
 *
 * Every Frame is capable of providing its SimTK::Transform (translation of
 * the origin and the orientation of its axes) in the Ground frame as a
 * function of the Model's (SimTK::MultibodySystem's) state.
 *
 * The Frame class also provides convenience methods for re-expressing vectors
 * from one Frame to another.
 *
 * As already noted, Frames are useful for locating physical structures such as
 * bodies, their joints, and the locations where constraints can be connected
 * and forces can be applied. It is perhaps less evident that Frames can be
 * extremely useful for relating a multitude of reference frames together to
 * form chains and trees. For example, a Frame to specify muscle attachments
 * (M) and a Frame to specify a joint location (J) could themselves be
 * specified in an anatomical Frame (A) defined by bony landmarks identified
 * by surface markers or tagged on CT or MRI images. The body (B), to which the
 * anatomical frame (A) is attached, can be thought of as a "Base" frame or a
 * root of a tree from which a set of descendant frames arise. In particular, a
 * Base frame and all its descendants have the property that they share the
 * same angular velocity, since they are affixed to the same underlying Frame
 * (in this case a Body).
 * <pre>
 *         M---muscle points
 *        /
 *   B---A
 *        \
 *         J---joint axes
 * </pre>
 * Therefore, a useful concept is that of a Base frame, and a Frame can always
 * provide a Base frame. If a Frame is not affixed to another frame, its Base
 * frame is itself.
