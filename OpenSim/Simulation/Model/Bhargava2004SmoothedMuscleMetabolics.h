/** This class implements the metabolic energy model of Bhargava et al (2004)
and provides an option to use smooth (i.e., twice continuously
differentiable) approximations. These approximations might be better suited
for gradient-based optimization algorithms.

We propose two smooth implementations.

In the first implementation, conditional if statements were approximated by
using hyperbolic tangent functions (tanh). For example, the following if
statement:
<pre>     y = a, if x <= d </pre>
<pre>     y = b, if x > d </pre>
can be approximated by:
<pre>     f = 0.5 + 0.5 tanh(b(x-d)) </pre>
<pre>     y = a + (-a + b) f </pre>
where b is a parameter that determines the smoothness of the transition.

In the second implementation, conditional if statements were approximated
by using Huber loss functions, which have the following form:
<pre>     L(f(x)) = 0.5 f(x)^2, if f(x) <= delta </pre>
<pre>     L(f(x)) = delta(f(x) - 0.5 delta), otherwise. </pre>
The Huber loss function is quadratic for f(x) <= delta and linear
otherwise, with equal value and slopes of the different sections at the
points where f(x) = delta (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huber_loss). In
our implementation, we scaled this function with a parameter b that
determines the smootheness of the transition between the quadratic and
linear parts. Note that this approximation is piecewise but still
continuous.

The metabolic energy model includes components for activation heat rate,
maintenance heat rate, shortening heat rate, and mechanical work rate.

The shortening heat rate model differs between concentric contractions and
eccentric contractions. We smoothed the transition between both contraction
types using our smoothing functions. Note that when using the force
dependent shortening proportional constant, we only provide the tanh
smoothing option for approximating the shortening heat rate. This is
motivated by the fact that the shortening heat rate is defined by linear
functions but with different non-zero constants of proportionality for
concentric and eccentric contractions. It is therefore easier to smooth the
transition between both contraction types with a tanh function than with a
Huber loss function. The difference between the original (non-smooth) and the
smooth implementations is illustrated in the following figure:

\htmlonly <style>div.image img[src="SmoothShorteningHeatRate.png"]{width:750px;}</style> \endhtmlonly
@image html SmoothShorteningHeatRate.png "Curves produced using isometricTotalActiveForce=350, fiberForceTotal=250, velocity_smoothing=10"

The mechanical work rate model includes negative mechanical work rate
(i.e., work rate resulting from eccentric contraction) by default. However,
if specified by the user, the model only takes positive mechanical work
rate (i.e., work rate resulting from concentric contraction) into account.
In such case, we smoothed the transition between positive rate and zero
using our smoothing functions. The difference between the original
(non-smooth) and the smooth implementations is illustrated in the following
figure:

\htmlonly <style>div.image img[src="SmoothMechanicalWorkRate.png"]{width:750px;}</style> \endhtmlonly
@image html SmoothMechanicalWorkRate.png "Curves produced using fiber_force_active=250, velocity_smoothing=10"

The metabolic energy model implementation includes an optional clamping
that prevents the total metabolic rate (i.e., total metabolic power) to be
negative. This clamping is done by increasing the shortening heat rate. We
smoothed the transition between positive and negative total metabolic rate
using our smoothing functions. The difference between the original
(non-smooth) and the smooth implementations is illustrated in the following
figure:

\htmlonly <style>div.image img[src="ClampingTotalMetabolicRate.png"]{width:750px;}</style> \endhtmlonly
@image html ClampingTotalMetabolicRate.png "Curves produced using shorteningHeatRate=totalRate/4, power_smoothing=10"

The metabolic energy model implementation includes an optional clamping
(see Umberger et al (2003), page 104) that prevents the total heat rate
(i.e., activation heat rate + maintenance heat rate + shortening heat rate)
for a given muscle to fall below 1.0 W/kg. Note that, if active, this
clamping will cause the sum of the reported individual heat rates and work
rate to differ from the reported metabolic rate. We smoothed the transition
between total heat rate higher and lower than 1.0 W/kg using our smoothing
functions. The difference between the original (non-smooth) and the smooth
implementations is illustrated in the following figure:

\htmlonly <style>div.image img[src="ClampingTotalHeatRate.png"]{width:750px;}</style> \endhtmlonly
@image html ClampingTotalHeatRate.png "Curves produced using muscle_mass=0.4, heat_rate_smoothing=10"

Note that the maintenance heat rate implementation relies on a
PiecewiseLinearFunction. The first and second order derivatives of this
function can be evaluated but they are discontinuous. This might cause
issues with gradient-based optimization algorithms. Problems using this
discontinuous function have successfully converged; therefore, we have
included it in this implementation of the model.

You can enable smoothing via the `use_smoothing` property. The smoothing type
('tanh' or 'huber') can be chosen via the `smoothing_type` property, and the
level of smoothing can be controlled by the `velocity_smoothing`,
`power_smoothing`, and `heat_rate_smoothing` properties.

Muscles to be included when computing the total metabolic rate should be
specified using one of the three `addMuscle()` function overloads. See the
properties of Bhargava2004SmoothedMuscleMetabolics_MuscleParameters() for the
default parameter values used when not specified via the second or third
`addMuscle()` overload.

@code
Bhargava2004SmoothedMuscleMetabolics* metabolics =
    new Bhargava2004SmoothedMuscleMetabolics();
metabolics->setName("metabolics");
metabolics->set_use_smoothing(true);

// The simplest way to add the muscle to the metabolics model: just provide the
name of the muscle and a reference to Muscle component.
metabolics->addMuscle("soleus_r", model.getComponent<Muscle>("soleus_r"));

// Provide the ratio of slow to fast twitch fibers and the specific tension of
muscle when adding it to the metabolics model. The values shown are also the 
default values.
double ratio_slow_twitch_fibers = 0.5;
double specific_tension = 0.25e6;
metabolics->addMuscle("gastroc_r", model.getComponent<Muscle>("gastroc_r"), 
        ratio_slow_twitch_fibers, specific_tension);

// Provide the slow and fast twitch fiber constants used to compute the 
// activation and maintenance heat rates. The values shown are also the default
// values.
double activation_constant_slow_twitch = 40.0;
double activation_constant_fast_twitch = 133.0;
double maintenance_constant_slow_twitch = 74.0;
double maintenance_constant_fast_twitch = 111.0;
metabolics->addMuscle("tibant_r", model.getComponent<Muscle>("tibant_r"),
        ratio_slow_twitch_fibers, specific_tension,
        activation_constant_slow_twitch, activation_constant_fast_twitch,
        maintenance_constant_slow_twitch, maintenance_constant_fast_twitch);

model.addComponent(metabolics);
model.finalizeConnections();
@endcode

The total metabolic rate output can be obtained using `getTotalMetabolicRate()`,
which takes a SimTK::State as a argument. You can similarly obtain the
individual heat rate and mechanical work rate components of the total metabolic
cost via `getTotalActivationRate()`, `getTotalMaintenanceRate()`,
`getTotalShorteningRate()`, and `getTotalMechanicalWorkRate()`. All outputs
require realizing the passed SimTK::State to SimTK::Stage::Dynamics.

@code
const auto& metabolics = 
    model.getComponent<Bhargava2004SmoothedMuscleMetabolics>("metabolics");
model.realizeDynamics(state);
double totalMetabolicRate = metabolics.getTotalMetabolicRate(state);
double activationHeatRate = metabolics.getTotalActivationRate(state);
