/** This applies to a body a force and/or torque that is fully specified as a 
function of time. It is defined by three sets of functions, all of which are 
optional:

  - Three functions that specify the (x,y,z) components of a force vector
    to apply (at a given point) as a function of time. If these functions are 
    not provided, no force is applied.

  - Three functions that specify the (x,y,z) components of a point location at 
    which the force should be applied. If these functions are not provided, the 
    force is applied at the body's origin (not necessarily the body's center 
    of mass).

  - Three functions that specify the (x,y,z) components of a pure torque 
    vector to apply. This is in addition to any torque resulting from the 
    applied force. If these functions are not provided, no additional torque 
    is applied.
