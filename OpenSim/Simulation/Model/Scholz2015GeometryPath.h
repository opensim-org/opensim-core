/**
 * \section Scholz2015GeometryPath
 * A concrete class representing a geometric path object defined by a list of
 * path points and wrapping obstacles.
 *
 * The path consists of straight line segments and curved line segments: a
 * curved segment over each obstacle, and straight segments connecting path
 * points to obstacles. If no obstacle lies between two path points, the points
 * will be connected by a straight line segment. The path is computed as a
 * geodesic to provide a shortest path over the surface. During a simulation,
 * the cable can slide freely over the obstacle surfaces. It can lose contact
 * with a surface and miss that obstacle in a straight line. Similarly the cable
 * can touchdown on the obstacle if the surface obstructs the straight line
 * segment again.
 *
 * The path is computed as an optimization problem using the previous optimal
 * path as the warm start. This is done by computing natural geodesic
 * corrections for each curve segment to compute the locally shortest path,
 * as described in the following publication:
 *
 *     Scholz, A., Sherman, M., Stavness, I. et al (2015). A fast multi-obstacle
 *     muscle wrapping method using natural geodesic variations. Multibody
 *     System Dynamics 36, 195â€“219.
 *
 * The overall path is locally the shortest, allowing winding over an obstacle
 * multiple times, without flipping to the other side.
 *
 * This class encapsulates `SimTK::CableSpan`, the Simbody implementation of
 * this algorithm. For the full details concerning this class, see the Simbody
 * API documentation.
 *
 * ## Constructing a Scholz2015GeometryPath
 *
 * The simplest valid path consists of two path points: an origin and an
 * insertion point:
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 * Model model = ModelFactory::createDoublePendulum();
 * Scholz2015GeometryPath* path = new Scholz2015GeometryPath();
 * path.addPathPoint(model.getGround(), SimTK::Vec3(0.05, 0.05, 0.));
 * path.addPathPoint(model.getComponent<Body>("/bodyset/b0"),
 *         SimTK::Vec3(-0.5, 0.1, 0.));
 * model.addComponent(path);
 * \endcode
 *
 * Typically, a Scholz2015GeometryPath will be used to define the geometry of
 * path-based force generating elements, e.g., `PathSpring`, `PathActuator`,
 * `Muscle`, etc. This example shows how to create a `PathSpring` and set the
 * 'path' property to a Scholz2015GeometryPath:
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 * auto* spring = new PathSpring();
 * spring->setName("path_spring");
 * spring->setRestingLength(0.25);
 * spring->setDissipation(0.75);
 * spring->setStiffness(10.0);
 * spring->set_path(Scholz2015GeometryPath());
 * model.addComponent(spring);
 *
 * auto& path = spring->updPath<Scholz2015GeometryPath>();
 * path.setName("path");
 * path.addPathPoint(model.getGround(), SimTK::Vec3(0.05, 0.05, 0));
 * path.addPathPoint(model.getComponent<Body>("/bodyset/b1"),
 *         SimTK::Vec3(-0.25, 0.1, 0));
 * \endcode
 *
 * @note The path points are stored using `Station` properties. Therefore, we
 * add path points *after* the `Scholz2015GeometryPath` has been added to the
 * `PathSpring`, so that the connections for each `Station`'s parent frame
 * `Socket` remain valid. If we instead called `set_path()` after each `Station`
 * property was set, the `Socket` connections would be broken when the
 * `Scholz2015GeometryPath` is copied into the `PathSpring`.
 *
 * ## Adding Wrap Obstacles
 *
 * Wrap obstacles are defined by `ContactGeometry` objects which encapsulate
 * a wrapping geometry, the `PhysicalFrame` that the geometry is attached to,
 * and the location and orientation of the geometry in that frame. The following
 * concrete implementations of `ContactGeometry` are recommended for use with
 * `Scholz2015GeometryPath`:
 * - `ContactSphere`
 * - `ContactCylinder`
 * - `ContactEllipsoid`
 * - `ContactTorus`
 *
 * Use `addObstacle()` to add a `ContactGeometry` wrapping obstacle to path,
 * along with a "contact hint" that is used to initialize the wrapping solver:
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 * auto* obstacle = new ContactCylinder(0.15,
 *         SimTK::Vec3(-0.2, 0.2, 0), SimTK::Vec3(0),
 *         model.getComponent<Body>("/bodyset/b0"));
 * model.addComponent(obstacle);
 * path.addObstacle(*obstacle, SimTK::Vec3(0., 0.15, 0.));
 * \endcode
 *
 * The contact hint is a `SimTK::Vec3` defining a point on the surface in local
 * surface frame coordinates. The point will be used to provide an initial guess
 * when solving for the path. As such, it does not have to lie on the contact
 * geometry's surface, nor does it have to belong to a valid cable path. For
 * obstacles with symmetry, the choice of the contact hint will determine which
 * side of the obstacle the path will wrap around.
 *
 * A `Scholz2015GeometryPath` must begin and end with a path point. Since we
 * added an obstacle, we must add an additional path point to "close" the path:
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 * path.addPathPoint(model.getComponent<Body>("/bodyset/b1"),
 *         SimTK::Vec3(-0.5, 0.1, 0.));
 * \endcode
 *
 * ## Path Ordering
 *
 * The order in which obstacles and path points are added to the path is
 * important. For example, consider the path we constructed above:
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 * path.addPathPoint(model.getGround(), SimTK::Vec3(0.05, 0.05, 0.));
 * path.addPathPoint(model.getComponent<Body>("/bodyset/b0"),
 *         SimTK::Vec3(-0.5, 0.1, 0.));
 * path.addObstacle(*obstacle, SimTK::Vec3(0., 0.15, 0.));
 * path.addPathPoint(model.getComponent<Body>("/bodyset/b1"),
 *         SimTK::Vec3(-0.5, 0.1, 0.));
 * \endcode
 *
 * Using the order of calls above, we have explicitly defined a cylinder
 * obstacle to apply to the path segment between the second and third path
 * points.
 *
 * By changing the order of the `addObstacle()` and `addPathPoint()` calls, we
 * could define a different path where a cylinder obstacle is applied to the
 * path segment between the first and second path points:
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 * path.addPathPoint(model.getGround(), SimTK::Vec3(0.05, 0.05, 0.));
 * path.addObstacle(*obstacle, SimTK::Vec3(0., 0.15, 0.));
 * path.addPathPoint(model.getComponent<Body>("/bodyset/b0"),
 *         SimTK::Vec3(-0.5, 0.1, 0.));
 * path.addPathPoint(model.getComponent<Body>("/bodyset/b1"),
 *         SimTK::Vec3(-0.5, 0.1, 0.));
 * \endcode
 *
 * The location of the cylinder obstacle in this new path would likely need to
 * be updated to a new location that is consistent with the segment between the
 * first and second path points to produce the desired wrapping behavior. Note
 * also that both of the path examples above are valid, since each begins and
 * ends with a path point.
 *
