/** This class represents the path of a frictionless cable from an origin point
fixed to a body, over geometric obstacles and through via points fixed to other 
bodies, to a final termination point.

The CableSpan's path can be seen as consisting of straight line segments and
curved line segments: A curved segment over each obstacle, and straight segments
connecting them to each other and to via points and the end points. Each curved 
segment is computed as a geodesic to give (in some sense) a shortest path over 
the surface. During a simulation the cable can slide freely over the obstacle 
surfaces. It can lose contact with a surface and miss that obstacle in a 
straight line. Similarly the cable can touchdown on the obstacle if the surface 
obstructs the straight line segment again. The cable will always slide freely 
through any via points present in the path.

The path is computed as an optimization problem using the previous optimal path
as the warm start. This is done by computing natural geodesic corrections for
each curve segment to compute the locally shortest path, as described in the
following publication:

    Scholz, A., Sherman, M., Stavness, I. et al (2015). A fast multi-obstacle
    muscle wrapping method using natural geodesic variations. Multibody System
    Dynamics 36, 195â€“219.

The overall path is locally the shortest, allowing winding over an obstacle
multiple times, without flipping to the other side.

During initialization the path is assumed to be in contact with each obstacle at
the user defined contact-point-hint. At each contact point a
zero-length-geodesic is computed with the tangent estimated as pointing from the
previous path point to the next path point. From this configuration, the solver
is started, and the geodesics will be corrected until the entire path is smooth.

Important to note is that the cable's interaction with the obstacles is ordered
based on the order in which they were added. That is, if three obstacles are
added to a cable, then, the cable can wrap over the first, then the second, and
then the third. If the first obstacle spatially collides with the path twice it
will not actually wrap over it twice. Use CablePath if this is not the desired
behavior.

When via points are present in the cable, the cable is internally divided into 
cable segments separated by the via points. Obstacles separated by via points 
have no interaction when geodesic corrections are applied during optimization,
and therefore the path for each cable segment is solved independently. This 
approach is advantageous since cable segments with different sets of wrap 
obstacles may require a different number of optimization iterations to converge.

Note that a CableSpan is a geometric object, not a force or constraint element.
That is, a CableSpan alone will not influence the behavior of a simulation.
However, forces and constraint elements can be constructed that make use of a
CableSpan to generate forces.

A CableSpan must be registered with a CableSubsystem which manages their
runtime evaluation. **/

 * 
 * ## Constructing a Scholz2015GeometryPath
 * 
 * The simplest path consists of a single line segment from an origin to an
 * insertion point. 
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 * Model model = ModelFactory::createDoublePendulum();
 * Scholz2015GeometryPath* path = new Scholz2015GeometryPath(
 *           model.getGround(), SimTK::Vec3(0.25, 0, 0),
 *           model.getComponent<Body>("/bodyset/b1"), SimTK::Vec3(-0.5, 0.1, 0));
 * model.addComponent(path);
 * \endcode
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 * auto* actu = new PathActuator();
 * actu->set_path(Scholz2015GeometryPath());
 * model.addComponent(actu);
 *
 * auto& path = actu->updPath<Scholz2015GeometryPath>();
 * path.setOrigin(model.getGround(), SimTK::Vec3(0.25, 0, 0));
 * path.setInsertion(model.getComponent<Body>("/bodyset/b1"), 
 *                   SimTK::Vec3(-0.5, 0.1, 0));
 * \endcode
 *
 * ## Adding Wrap Obstacles
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * auto* ellipsoid = new ContactEllipsoid(SimTK::Vec3(0.1, 0.1, 0.3),
 *         SimTK::Vec3(0., 0.2, 0), SimTK::Vec3(0), model.getGround());
 * model.addComponent(ellipsoid);
 *
 * path.addObstacle(*ellipsoid, SimTK::Vec3(0.1, 0., 0.));
 * \endcode
 *
 * ## Adding Via Points
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 * path.addViaPoint(model.getComponent<Body>("/bodyset/body"), 
 *         SimTK::Vec3(0.1, 0., 0.));
 * \endcode
 *
 * ## Path Ordering
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * path.addObstacle(*ellipsoid, SimTK::Vec3(0.1, 0., 0.));
 * path.addViaPoint(model.getComponent<Body>("/bodyset/body"), SimTK::Vec3(0));
 * path.addObstacle(*sphere, SimTK::Vec3(0., 0.5, 0.));
 * \endcode
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 * path.addObstacle(*ellipsoid, SimTK::Vec3(0.1, 0., 0.));
 * path.addObstacle(*sphere, SimTK::Vec3(0., 0.5, 0.));
 * path.addViaPoint(model.getComponent<Body>("/bodyset/body"), SimTK::Vec3(0));
 * \endcode
