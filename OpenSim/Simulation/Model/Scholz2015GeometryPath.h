/**
 * \section Scholz2015GeometryPath
 * A concrete class representing a path object that begins at an origin point
 * fixed to a body, wraps over geometric obstacles and passes through
 * frictionless via points fixed to other bodies, and terminates at an insertion
 * point.
 *
 * The path consists of straight line segments and curved line segments: a 
 * curved segment over each obstacle, and straight segments connecting them to 
 * each other and to via points and the end points. Each curved segment is 
 * computed as a geodesic to give (in some sense) a shortest path over the 
 * surface. During a simulation the cable can slide freely over the obstacle 
 * surfaces. It can lose contact with a surface and miss that obstacle in a 
 * straight line. Similarly the cable can touchdown on the obstacle if the
 * surface obstructs the straight line segment again. The cable will always
 * slide freely through any via points present in the path.
 *
 * The path is computed as an optimization problem using the previous optimal
 * path as the warm start. This is done by computing natural geodesic
 * corrections for each curve segment to compute the locally shortest path,
 * as described in the following publication:
 *
 *     Scholz, A., Sherman, M., Stavness, I. et al (2015). A fast multi-obstacle
 *     muscle wrapping method using natural geodesic variations. Multibody
 *     System Dynamics 36, 195â€“219.
 *
 * The overall path is locally the shortest, allowing winding over an obstacle
 * multiple times, without flipping to the other side.
 *
 * This class encapsulates `SimTK::CableSpan`, the Simbody implementation of
 * this algorithm. For the full details concerning this class, see the Simbody 
 * API documentation.
 * 
 * ## Constructing a Scholz2015GeometryPath
 * 
 * The simplest path consists of a single line segment from an origin to an
 * insertion point:
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 * Model model = ModelFactory::createDoublePendulum();
 * Scholz2015GeometryPath* path = new Scholz2015GeometryPath(
 *           model.getGround(), SimTK::Vec3(0.25, 0, 0),
 *           model.getComponent<Body>("/bodyset/b1"), SimTK::Vec3(-0.5, 0.1, 0));
 * model.addComponent(path);
 * \endcode
 *
 * Typically, a Scholz2015GeometryPath will be used to define the geometry of
 * path-based force generating elements, e.g., `PathSpring`, `PathActuator`,
 * `Muscle`, etc. This example shows how to create a `PathSpring` and set the 
 * 'path' property to a Scholz2015GeometryPath: 
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 * auto* spring = new PathSpring();
 * spring->setName("path_spring");
 * spring->setRestingLength(0.5);
 * spring->setDissipation(0.5);
 * spring->setStiffness(25.0);
 * spring->set_path(Scholz2015GeometryPath());
 * model.addComponent(spring);
 *
 * auto& path = spring->updPath<Scholz2015GeometryPath>();
 * path.setName("path");
 * path.setOrigin(model.getGround(), SimTK::Vec3(0.25, 0, 0));
 * path.setInsertion(model.getComponent<Body>("/bodyset/b1"), 
 *                   SimTK::Vec3(-0.5, 0.1, 0));
 * \endcode
 *
 * The origin and insertion points are stored using `Station` properties.
 * Therefore, we update these properties *after* the `Scholz2015GeometryPath`
 * has been added to the `PathSpring`, so that the `Socket` connections in each
 * `Station` remain valid. If we called `set_path()` after each `Station`
 * property was set, the `Socket` connections would be broken when
 * the `Scholz2015GeometryPath` is copied into the `PathSpring`.
 *
 * ## Adding Wrap Obstacles
 *
 * Wrap obstacles are defined by `ContactGeometry` objects which encapsulate
 * a wrapping geometry, the `PhysicalFrame` that the geometry is attached to,
 * and the location and orientation of the geometry in that frame. The following
 * concrete implementations of `ContactGeometry` are recommended for use with
 * Scholz2015GeometryPath:
 * - `ContactSphere`
 * - `ContactCylinder`
 * - `ContactEllipsoid`
 * - `ContactTorus`
 *
 * Use `addObstacle()` to add a `ContactGeometry` wrapping obstacle to path, 
 * along with a "contact hint" that is used to initialize the wrapping solver:
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 * auto* ellipsoid = new ContactEllipsoid(SimTK::Vec3(0.1, 0.1, 0.3),
 *         SimTK::Vec3(0., 0.2, 0), SimTK::Vec3(0), model.getGround());
 * model.addComponent(ellipsoid);
 *
 * path.addObstacle(*ellipsoid, SimTK::Vec3(0.1, 0., 0.));
 * \endcode
 *
 * The contact hint is a `SimTK::Vec3` defining a point on the surface in local
 * surface frame coordinates. The point will be used as a starting point when
 * computing the initial cable path. As such, it does not have to lie on the
 * contact geometry's surface, nor does it have to belong to a valid cable path.
 *
 * ## Adding Via Points
 *
 * Via points are `Station`s owned by `Scholz2015GeometryPath` that the path
 * will freely slide through. Use the `addViaPoint()` method to provide both the
 * `PhysicalFrame` and body-fixed location of a new via point in the path:
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 * path.addViaPoint(model.getComponent<Body>("/bodyset/body"), 
 *         SimTK::Vec3(0.1, 0., 0.));
 * \endcode
 * 
 * The full set of via points is stored in the `via_points` list property.
 *
 * When via points are present, the path is internally divided into
 * multiple path segments. The origin and insertion of each segment are defined 
 * by `Socket`s which are connected to either the `origin` or `insertion` 
 * properties of `Scholz2015GeometryPath`, or to the `Station` of a via point.
 * Path segments are automatically created and managed internally using
 * `Scholz2015GeometryPathSegment`, which also provides the means for
 * serializing and deserializing `Scholz2015GeometryPath` objects while
 * preserving the correct order of wrapping obstacles and via points. Users need
 * not create or manage `Scholz2015GeometryPathSegment` objects directly.
 *
 * ## Path Ordering
 *
 * The order in which obstacles and via points are added to the path is
 * important. For example, a `Scholz2015GeometryPath` could be constructed with
 * two wrapping obstacles separated by a via point, as follows:
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 * path.addObstacle(*ellipsoid, SimTK::Vec3(0.1, 0., 0.));
 * path.addViaPoint(model.getComponent<Body>("/bodyset/body"), SimTK::Vec3(0));
 * path.addObstacle(*sphere, SimTK::Vec3(0., 0.5, 0.));
 * \endcode
 *
 * By changing the order of the `addObstacle()` and `addViaPoint()` calls, we 
 * could define a different path where the two wrap obstacles exist in the same
 * path segment: 
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 * path.addObstacle(*ellipsoid, SimTK::Vec3(0.1, 0., 0.));
 * path.addObstacle(*sphere, SimTK::Vec3(0., 0.5, 0.));
 * path.addViaPoint(model.getComponent<Body>("/bodyset/body"), SimTK::Vec3(0));
 * \endcode
 *
 * Both paths will have two internal path segments since one via point was
 * added in each. However, in the first path, each segment will have one wrap
 * obstacle, while in the second path, the first segment will have two wrap
 * obstacles and the second segment will have no wrap obstacles.
 *
