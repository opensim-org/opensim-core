* A PhysicalFrame is a Frame that locates a physical element of the multi-

* Attributes of a Body (its center-of-mass, geometry, ...) are located in the
* Body frame. Bodies are connected by Joints and Constraints and Forces are 
* readily applied to them. A location that represents an offset from the Body
* frame, can also be a PhysicalFrame (e.g. a PhysicalOffsetFrame).
