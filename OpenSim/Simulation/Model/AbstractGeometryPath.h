//=============================================================================
/**
 * A base class that represents a path that has a computable length and
 * lengthening speed.
 *
 * This class is typically used in places where the model needs to simulate
 * the changes in a path over time. For example, in `OpenSim::Muscle`s,
 * `OpenSim::Ligament`s, etc.
 *
 * This class *only* defines a length and lengthening speed. We do not assume
 * that an `OpenSim::AbstractGeometryPath` is a straight line between two points
 * or assume that it is many straight lines between `n` points. The derived
 * implementation may define a path using points, or it may define a path using
 * a curve fit. It may also define a path based on analytical functions for the
 * length and lengthening speed.
