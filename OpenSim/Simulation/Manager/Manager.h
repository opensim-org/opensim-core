/**
 * \section Manager
 * A class that manages the execution of a simulation.
 *
 * This class uses a SimTK::Integrator and SimTK::TimeStepper to perform the
 * simulation. By default, a Runge-Kutta-Merson integrator is used, but can be
 * changed by using setIntegratorMethod().
 *
 * \subsection man_usage Usage
 * The basic usage of a Manager is to construct it with a Model and then call
 * initialize() and integrate():
 *
 * @code
 * SimTK::State state = model.initSystem();
 * Manager manager(model);
 * manager.initialize(state);
 * state = manager.integrate(1.0);
 * @endcode
 *
 * See the documentation for integrate() for more usage examples.
 *
 * \subsection man_int_step SimTK::Integrator and SimTK::TimeStepper consistency
 * Upon construction, a Manager creates a SimTK::Integrator (defaulted to
 * SimTK::RungeKuttaMersonIntegrator) and a SimTK::TimeStepper. These will only
 * be changed if setIntegratorMethod() is called. Therefore, any changes to the
 * SimTK::Integrator (e.g., via setIntegratorAccuracy()) should be made after
 * calling setIntegratorMethod(). Otherwise, these settings will be overridden
 * when setIntegratorMethod() is called.
 *
 * \subsection man_init Initializing a Manager
 * After configuring the SimTK::Integrator, call the initialize() method to
 * initialize the Manager. This method initializes the internal
 * SimTK::TimeStepper and prepares data structures to record simulation
 * trajectory (e.g., if setRecordStatesTrajectory() or setWriteToStorage()
 * are set to true).
 *
 * Manager::initialize() must be called before calling Manager::integrate(). A
 * Manager may be reinitialized by calling initialize() with a different
 * initial State. Note that this effectively resets the simulation: the internal
 * SimTK::TimeStepper is reinitialized and the internal data structures are
 * cleared.
 *
 * \subsection man_results Obtaining simulation results
 * Results from a simulation can be obtained by enabling the appropriate
 * settings before calling Manager::integrate(). Manager::setPerformAnalyses()
 * enables the execution of all analyses registered with the Model during the
 * simulation via AnalysisSet::step() and is enabled by default.
 * Manager::setWriteToStorage() enables the writing of the simulation results to
 * a Storage object and is also enabled by default.
 * Manager::setRecordStatesTrajectory() enables the recording of a full
 * StatesTrajectory during a simulation; this setting is disabled by default
 * since it can have a significant impact on performance.
 *
 * When setWriteToStorage(true) is called, use getStateStorage() or
 * getStatesTable() to obtain the simulation trajectory. When
 * setRecordStatesTrajectory(true) is called, use getStatesTrajectory() to
 * obtain the simulation trajectory.
