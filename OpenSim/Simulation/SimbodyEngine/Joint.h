/**
An OpenSim Joint is an OpenSim::ModelComponent which connects two PhysicalFrames
together and specifies their relative permissible motion as described in
internal coordinates. The base Joint specifies two frames (e.g. one per body),
which the joint spans. The relative motion (including the # of coordinates)
are defined by concrete Joints, which specify the permissible kinematics of
a child joint frame (on a child body) with respect to a parent joint frame
(on a parent body). The designation of parent and child are used only to
identify the directionality of the joint and in which frame the joint
coordinates are expressed.

For example, A PinJoint between a parent frame, P, and a child frame, B,
has a coordinate value of zero when the two frames are aligned and
positive coordinate values are the angle between the frames' X-axes given
a positive Z-rotation of the child frame about the coincident Z-axis in
the parent frame.

Note: the parent and child frames must be added to the model by the time
      you call initSystem() on the model.

Concrete Joints can specify relative translations and even coupled
rotations and translations (see EllipsoidJoint and CustomJoint). For more
details on how the underlying formulation supports coupled curvilinear
joints, see "Minimal formulation of joint motion for biomechanisms", 2010

<b>C++ example</b>
\code{.cpp}
// Define a pin joint that attaches pendulum (an OpenSim::Body) to ground.
PinJoint* myPin = new PinJoint("pendulumToGround", myModel.getGround(),
                               pendulum);
\endcode

<b>Python example</b>
\code{.py}
    # Define a ball joint between blockA and blockB.
    abJoint = osim.BallJoint('JointName', blockA, blockB)
\endcode

If you want to connect to an existing PhysicalFrame (e.g., a Body or Ground)
but not to its origin, you can create and connect to a PhysicalOffsetFrame; the
following convenience constructor does this for you:

<b>C++ example</b>
\code{.cpp}
// Define a pin joint that attaches the end of pendulum to the ground origin.
PinJoint* myPin = new PinJoint("pendulumToGround",
                               myModel.getGround(),   //parent PhysicalFrame
                               Vec3(0),               //location in parent
                               Vec3(0),               //orientation in parent
                               pendulum,              //child PhysicalFrame
                               Vec3(0,-length/2.,0),  //location in child
                               Vec3(0));              //orientation in child
