/**
An OpenSim Joint is an OpenSim::ModelComponent which connects two Bodies
together and speficies their relative permissible motion as described in
internal coordinates. The base Joint specifies the two frames (on each body),
which the joint spans. The relative motion (including the # of coordinates)
are defined by concrete Joints, which specify the permissible kinematics of
a child joint frame (on a child body) with respect to a parent joint frame
(on a parent body). The designation of parent and child are used only to
identify the directionality of the joint and in which frame the joint
coordinates are expressed.

For example, A PinJoint between a parent, P, and a child body, B,
frames have a coordinate value of zero when the two frames are aligned
and positive coordinate values are the angle between the frames' X-axes given
a positive Z-rotation of the child frame about the coincident Z-axis in
the parent frame.

Concrete Joints can specify relative translations and even coupled
rotations and translations (see EllipsoidJoint and CustomJoint). For more
details on how the underlying formulation supports coupled curvilinear
joints, see "Minimal formulation of joint motion for biomechanisms", 2010
