/**
 * An OpenSim Joint is an OpenSim::ModelComponent which connects two Bodies 
 * together and speficies their relative permissible motion as described in  
 * internal coordinates. The base Joint specifies the two frames (on each body),
 * which the joint spans. The relative motion (including the # of coordinates)
 * are defined by concrete Joints, which specify the permissible kinematics of
 * a child joint frame (on a child body) with respect to a parent joint frame
 * (on a parent body). The designation of parent and child are used only to
 * identify the directionality of the joint and in which frame the joint
 * coordinates are expressed. For example, A PinJoint between a parent, P, 
 * and a child body, B, frames has a coordinate value of zero when the two 
 * frames are aligned and positive coordinate values are the angle between the 
 * frames' X-axes given a positive Z-rotation of the child frame about the  
 * coincident Z-axis in the parent frame.
 *
 * Concrete Joints can specify relative translations and even coupled 
 * rotations and translations (@see EllipsoidJoint and CustomJoint). For more
 * details on how the underlying formulation supports coupled curvilinear
 * joints, see "Minimal formulation of joint motion for biomechanisms", 2010
