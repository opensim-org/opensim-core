/**
 * Solve for the coordinates (degrees-of-freedom) of the model that satisfy the
 * set of constraints imposed on the model as well as set of desired coordinate
 * values.  The InverseKinematics provides the option to convert the problem to  
 * an approximate one where the constraint violations are treated as penalties
 * to be minimized rather than strictly enforced. This can speed up the time
 * solution and can be used to seed the constrained problem near to a solution.
 *
 * The InverseKinematics objective: 
 *   min J = sum(Wm*(m_i-md_i)^T*(m_i-md_i)) + sum(Wq_i*(q_i-qd_i)^2)) + [Wc*sum(c_err)^2]
 * where m_i and md_i are the model and desired marker coordinates (Vec3) 
 * iff Wc == Infinity, second term is not included, but
 *  A is subject to the constraint equations:  G(q)-Go = 0
 *
 * When the model (and the number of goals) is guaranteed not to change and the 
 * the initial state is close to the InverseKinematics solution (from initial assemble(),
 * then track() is a efficient method for updating the configuration to track
 * the small change to the desired coorindate value.
 *
 * See SimTK::Assembler for more algorithmic details of the underlying solver.
