/**
 * Solve for the coordinates (degrees of freedom) of the model that satisfy the
 * set of constraints imposed on the model and the set of desired coordinate
 * values. The InverseKinematicsSolver provides the option to convert the
 * problem to an approximate one where the constraint violations are treated as
 * penalties to be minimized rather than strictly enforced. This can speed up
 * the solution and can be used to seed the constrained problem closer to the
 * solution.
 *
 * The InverseKinematicsSolver objective:
 * \f[
 *   min: J = sum(Wm_i*(m_i-md_i)^T*(m_i-md_i)) + sum(Wq_j*(q_j-qd_j)^2) +
 *            [Wc*sum(c_{err})^2]
 * \f]
 * where m_i and md_i are the model and desired marker locations (Vec3); q_j
 * and qd_j are model and desired joint coordinates. Wm_i and Wq_j are the
 * marker and coordinate weightings, respectively, and Wc is the weighting on
 * constraint errors. When Wc == Infinity, the second term is not included,
 * but instead q is subject to the constraint equations:
 *      \f[ c_{err} = G(q)-Go = 0 \f]
 *
 * When the model (and the number of goals) is guaranteed not to change and
 * the initial state is close to the InverseKinematics solution (e.g., from the 
 * initial assemble()), then track() is an efficient method for updating the
 * configuration to determine the small change in coordinate values, q.
 *
 * See SimTK::Assembler for more algorithmic details of the underlying solver.
