            Additional options include the name of the base IMU and its axis that
            represents the heading (forward) direction. These are used to perform
            a heading correction on all the experimental (quaternion) data so that
            when tracking rotation data, the initial pose of the model is facing
            forward. If the baseImuName is empty, no correction is made. If no
            direction is specified, the default is the Z axis. Final optional argument
            is the Rotation matrix that maps the IMU World reference frame to
            OpenSim's ground reference frame. The default is to rotate -Pi/2
            about the IMU world X-axis to get IMU World Z-axis to point up as

            modelCalibrationPoseFile: a model file where default pose matches that

            calibrationOrientationsFile: a storage file with IMU orientations 
                                         expressed as Quaternions.
            baseImuName: The label of the base IMU in the orientations_file used
                         to account for the heading difference between the sensor
                         data and the forward direction of the model. Leave blank
                         if no heading correction is to be applied.
            baseHeadingDirection: The axis of the base IMU that corresponds to its
                             heading direction. Options are SimTK::X/Y/ZAxis, along with
                             direction of +1/-1
            Assumptions about the inputs: 
             1) the model default pose is the same as the pose used to collect
                calibration data
             2) the sensors are labeled <body(or physical frame)_in_model>_imu in
                the orientations data. The underlying PhysicalFrame in the model
                is then identified and a corresponding Offset frame is attached, 
                which represents the sensor affixed to the model.
