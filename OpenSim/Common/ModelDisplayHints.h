//                           MODEL DISPLAY HINTS
//==============================================================================
/** This class captures information indicating user or programmer preferences 
to guide automatic display geometry generation by a Model. Fields here may be
set programmatically or as a result of user choices made in the GUI or 
ModelVisualizer. Any display-generating code including the GUI, ModelVisualizer,
and any geometry-generating ModelComponent will be supplied with one of these 
so that it can modify its behavior if there are any fields it recognizes. 

If you are writing a ModelComponent that generates some of its own geometry,
and you would like people to consider it well-behaved, you should check whether
any of the flags here might reasonably be expected to affect the geometry that
your component produces. The currently-supported flags are:
  - show wrap geometry
  - show contact geometry
  - show muscle paths (should apply to other path objects too)
  - show path points
  - show markers
  - show forces
  - show frames
  - show labels
  - show debug geometry

This class is intended to provide some minimal user control over generated
geometry in a form that is easy for a ModelComponent author to deal with, since
the OpenSim user interface won't know anything about that component or its
geometry. Nothing prevents a user interface from providing much more 
sophisticated control of display features that it understands and the OpenSim
GUI does that.

If you would like to see some additional generally-useful flags or options 
supported here, please file a feature request or post to the OpenSim forum on 
SimTK.org.

@note The "set" methods here return a reference to the object so they can
be chained for convenience like assignment statements.
