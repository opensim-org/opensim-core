     * @brief Applies a lowpass filter to the data in a TimeSeriesTable at a
     * specified cutoff frequency.
     *
     * This function first checks if the provided cutoff frequency is
     * non-negative. If the `padData` parameter is set to true, the data is
     * mirror padded using the `pad()` function.
     * The amount of padding is half the number of rows in the table on each side.
     * In other words, using numRowsToPrependAndAppend = table.getNumRows() / 2.
     * This will make the resulting data twice as long as the original and may 
     * include "negative" time if the original independent (time) column began at 0.
     *
     * The function then verifies that the number of rows in the table is at
     * least 4, as filtering requires a minimum amount of data. It retrieves the
     * independent time column and checks if the time samples are uniformly
     * spaced. If the time intervals are not uniform, the data is resampled to
     * ensure consistent sampling before applying the lowpass filter. 
     * See `CommonUtilities.h` for more information on how the uniform sampling 
     * is calculated to determine if the data should be resampled.
     *
     * The filtering is performed using the `Signal::LowpassIIR()` method, which
     * processes each dependent column of the table with the specified cutoff
     * frequency and the determined sampling interval.
     *
     * @param table A reference to the TimeSeriesTable containing the data to be
     * filtered.
     * @param cutoffFreq The cutoff frequency for the lowpass filter. Must be
     * non-negative.
     * @param padData A boolean indicating whether to pad the data before
     * filtering.
     *
     * @throws Exception if the cutoff frequency is negative, if the number of
     * rows is less than 4, or if the time intervals are not suitable for
     * resampling.
