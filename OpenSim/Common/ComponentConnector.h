/** @file
 * This file defines the Connector class, which formalizes the dependency of 
 * of a Component on another Object/Component in order to operate, BUT it does 
 * not own it. While Components can be composites (of multiple components) 
 * they often depend on unrelated objects/components that are defined and
 * owned elsewhere.
 *
 * For example a Joint connects two bodies together, but the Joint does 
 * not own either body. Instead, the Joint has Connectors to a parent and 
 * a child body that already exists. The maintenance of the dependency and 
 * the run-time verification of the existence of the bodies is the duty
 * of the Connector.

//=============================================================================
/**
 * A Connector formalizes the dependency between a Component and another object
 * (typically another Component) without owning that object. The object that
 * satisfies the requirements of the Connector we term the "connectee". When a 
 * Connector is satisfied by a connectee we have a successful "connection" or
 * is said to be connected.
 *
 * The purpose of a Connector is to specify: 1) the connectee type that the
 * Component is dependent on, 2) by when (what stage) the connector must be
 * connected in order for the component to function, 3) the name of a connectee
 * that can be found at run-time to satisfy the connector, and 4) whether or
 * not it is connected. A Connector maintains a reference to the instance
 * (connectee) until it is disconnected.
 *
 * For example, a Joint has two Connectors for the parent and child Bodies that
 * it joins. The type for the connector is a PhysicalFrame and any attempt to 
 * connect to a non-Body (or frame rigidly attached to a Body) will throw an
 * exception. The connectAt Stage is Topology. That is, the Joint's connection to
 * a Body must be performed at the Topology system stage, and any attempt to
 * change the connection status will invalidate that Stage and above.
 *
 * Other Components like a Marker or a Probe that do not change the system
 * topology or add new states could potentially be connected at later stages
 * like Model or Instance.

/** A specialized Connector that connects to an Output signal is an Input.
An AbstractInput enables maintenance of a list of unconnected Inputs. 
An Input can either be a single-value Input or a list Input. A list Input
can connect to multiple (Output) Channels.

#### Syntax of `connectee_name`

The XML representation of this class allows one to specify, via the
`connectee_name` property, the outputs/channels that should be connected to
this input (that is, the connectees). The syntax for the `connectee_name`
property is as follows:
@verbatim
<path/to/component/><output_name>[:<channel_name>][(<annotation>)]
@endverbatim
Angle brackets indicate fields that one would fill in, and square brackets
indicate optional fields. The `<path/to/component>` can be relative or
absolute, and describes the location of the Component that contains the 
desired Output relative to the location of the Component that contains this
Input. The `<path/to/component>` and `<output_name>` must always be specified.
The `<channel_name>` should only be specified if the %Output is a list output
(i.e., it has multiple channels). The `<annotation>` is a name for the
output/channel that is specific to this input, and it is optional (if left out,
the annotation becomes the channel name).
All fields should contain only letters, numbers, and underscores (the path
to the component can contain slashes and periods); fields must *not* contain
spaces.
Here are some examples:
 - `../marker_data/column:left_ankle`: The TableSourceVec3 component
   `../marker_data` has a list output `column`, and we want to connect to its
   `left_ankle` channel.
 - `../averager/output(knee_joint_center)`: The component `../averager`
   (presumably a component that averages its inputs) has an output named
   `output`, and we are annotating this output as `knee_joint_center`.
 - `/leg_model/soleus/activation`: This connectee name uses the absolute path
   to component `soleus`, which has an output named `activation`.

List inputs can contain multiple entries in its `connectee_name`, with the
entries separated by a space. For example:
@verbatim
../marker_data/column:left_ankle ../marker_data/column:right_ankle ../averager/output(knee_joint_center)
@endverbatim
