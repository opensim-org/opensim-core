 * DataAdapter is an abstract class defining an interface for reading/writing
 * in/out the contents of a DataTable. It enables access to/from various data
 * sources/sinks such as: streams, files, databases and devices. The DataTable
 * is independent of the form and format of the data in/out of the source/sink.
 * Concrete classes handle the details (e.g. format, sequential access, etc...) 
 * associated with a particular data source/sink.
 *
 * The base DataAdapter contains a static registry to serve as a factory for 
 * concrete DataAdpaters, given a string identifier of the type of adapter.
 * The adapter knows the source format and data flow (read, write, both).
 * String identifiers can be associated with file formats according to known
 * file extensions.                                                           */
