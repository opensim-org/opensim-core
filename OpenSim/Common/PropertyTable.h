//==============================================================================
/**
 * A property table is the container that an OpenSim Object uses to hold its
 * properties (each derived from base class AbstractProperty). It provides 
 * methods to add properties to the table, and preserves the order with which 
 * they are defined. Methods for retrieving properties by name or by ordinal
 * are provided. The table is the owner of the individual property objects and
 * those are deleted when the table is deleted.
 *
 * Duplicate property names are not allowed in the same property table. Some
 * properties are unnamed, however; that is only allowed when the property
 * holds a single object, and we use the object class name as though it were
 * the property's name (and they can still be looked up by ordinal also). That
 * means no Object can contain two unnamed properties holding the same type of
 * object since that would appear as a duplicate name.
