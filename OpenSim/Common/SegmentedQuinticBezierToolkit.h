/**
This is a low level Quintic Bezier curve class that contains functions to design
continuous sets of 'C' shaped Bezier curves, and to evaluate their values and
derivatives. A set in this context is used to refer to 2 or more quintic Bezier
curves that are continuously connected to eachother to form one smooth curve,
hence the name QuinticBezierSet.

In the special case when this class is being used to generate and evaluate
2D Bezier curves, that is x(u) and y(u), there are also functions to evaluate
y(x), the first six derivatives of y(x), and also the first integral of y(x).

This class was not designed to be a stand alone Quintic Bezier class, but rather
was developed out of necessity to model muscles. I required curves that, when
linearly extrapolated, were C2 continuous, and by necessity I had to use
quintic Bezier curves. In addition, the curves I was developing were functions
in x,y space, allowing many of the methods (such as the evaluation of y(x) given
that x(u) and y(u), the derivatives of y(x), and its first integral) to be
developed, though in general this can't always be done.

I have parcelled all of these tools into their own class so that others may more
easily use and develop this starting point for their own means. I used the
following text during the development of this code:

Mortenson, Michael E (2006). Geometric Modeling Third Edition. Industrial Press
Inc., New York. Chapter 4 was quite helpful.

<B>Future Upgrades</B>

1. Analytical Inverse to x(u).

I think this is impossible because it is not possible, in general, to find the
roots to a quintic polynomial, however, this fact may not preclude forming the
inverse curve. The impossibility of finding the roots to a quintic polynomial
was proven by Abel (Abel's Impossibility Theorem) and Galois

http://mathworld.wolfram.com/QuinticEquation.html

At the moment I am approximating the curve u(x) using cubic splines to return
an approximate value for u(x), which I polish using Newton's method to the
desired precision.

2. Analytical Integral of y(x)

This is possible using the Divergence Theorem applied to 2D curves. A nice
example application is shown in link 2 for computing the area of a closed
cubic Bezier curve. While I have been able to get the simple examples to work,
I have failed to successfully compute the area under a quintic Bezier curve
correctly. I ran out of time trying to fix this problem, and so at the present
time I am numerically computing the integral at a number of knot points and
then evaluating the spline to compute the integral value.

a. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence_theorem
b. http://objectmix.com/graphics/133553-area-closed-bezier-curve.html

3. calcU

Currently the Bezier curve value and its derivative are computed separately to
evaluate f and df in the Newton iteration to solve for u(x). Code optimized to
compute both of these quantites at the same time could cut the cost of
evaluating x(u) and dx/du in half. Since these quantities are evaluated in an
iterative loop, this one change could yield substantial computational savings.

4. calcIndex

The function calcIndex computes which spline the contains the point of interest.
This function has been implemented assuming a small number of Bezier curve sets,
and so it simply linearly scans through the sets to determine the correct one to
use. This function should be upgraded to use the bisection method if large
quintic Bezier curve sets are desired.

5. The addition of additional Bezier control point design algorithms, to create
'S' shaped curves, and possibly do subdivision.

6. Low level Code Optimization

I have exported all of the low level code as optimized code from Maple. Although
the code produced using this means is reasonably fast, it is usally possible
to obtain superiour performance (and sometimes less round off error) by
doing this work by hand.

<B>Computational Cost Details</B>
All computational costs assume the following operation costs:

\verbatim
Operation Type   : #flops
+,-,=,Boolean Op : 1
               / : 10
             sqrt: 20
             trig: 40
\endverbatim

These relative weightings will vary processor to processor, and so any of
the quoted computational costs are approximate.

    This function numerically integrates the Bezier curve y(x), when really
    both x and y are specified in terms of u. Evaluate the integral at the
    locations specified in vX and return the result.

    <B>Computational Costs</B>

    This the expense of this function depends on the number of points in
    vX, the points for which the integral y(x) must be calculated. The
    integral is evaluated using a Runge Kutta 45 integrator, and so each
    point requires 6 function evaluations.
    (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dormand%E2%80%93Prince_method)

    The cost of evaluating 1 Bezier curve y(x) scales with the number
    of points in xVal:
    \verbatim
        ~1740 flops per point
    \endverbatim

    The example below is quite involved, but just so it can show you an
    example of how to create the array of Spline objects that approximate
    the function u(x). Although the example has been created for only 1
    Bezier curve set, simply changing the size and entries of the matricies
    _mX and _mY will allow multiple sets to be integrated.
