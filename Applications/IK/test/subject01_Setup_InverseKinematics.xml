	  <!--Name of file containing the joint angles used to set the initial

	      These coordinate values can also be included in the optimization
	      problem used to place the markers. Before the model markers are
	      placed, a single frame of an inverse kinematics (IK) problem is
	      solved. The IK problem can be solved simply by matching marker
	      positions, but if the model markers are not in the correct locations,
	      the IK solution will not be very good and neither will marker
	      placement. Alternatively, coordinate values (specified in this file)
	      can be specified and used to influence the IK solution. This is
	      valuable particularly if you have high confidence in the coordinate
	      values. For example, you know for the static trial the subject was
	      standing will all joint angles close to zero. If the coordinate set
	      (see the CoordinateSet property) contains non-zero weights for
	      coordinates, the IK solution will try to match not only the marker
	      positions, but also the coordinates in this file. Least-squared error
	      is used to solve the IK problem.-->
