	    These coordinate values can also be included in the optimization
	    problem used to place the markers. Before the model markers are
	    placed, a single frame of an inverse kinematics (IK) problem is
	    solved. The IK problem can be solved simply by matching marker
	    positions, but if the model markers are not in the correct locations,
	    the IK solution will not be very good and neither will marker
	    placement. Alternatively, coordinate values (specified in this file)
	    can be specified and used to influence the IK solution. This is
	    valuable particularly if you have high confidence in the coordinate
	    values. For example, you know for the static trial the subject was
	    standing will all joint angles close to zero. If the coordinate set
	    (see the CoordinateSet property) contains non-zero weights for
	    coordinates, the IK solution will try to match not only the marker
	    positions, but also the coordinates in this file. Least-squared error
	    is used to solve the IK problem.-->
