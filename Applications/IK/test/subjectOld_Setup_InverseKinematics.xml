				    These coordinate values can also be included in the optimization
				    problem used to place the markers. Before the model markers are
				    placed, a single frame of an inverse kinematics (IK) problem is
				    solved. The IK problem can be solved simply by matching marker
				    positions, but if the model markers are not in the correct locations,
				    the IK solution will not be very good and neither will marker
				    placement. Alternatively, coordinate values (specified in this file)
				    can be specified and used to influence the IK solution. This is
				    valuable particularly if you have high confidence in the coordinate
				    values. For example, you know for the static trial the subject was
				    standing will all joint angles close to zero. If the coordinate set
				    (see the CoordinateSet property) contains non-zero weights for
				    coordinates, the IK solution will try to match not only the marker
				    positions, but also the coordinates in this file. Least-squared error
				    is used to solve the IK problem.-->
