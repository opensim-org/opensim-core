These coordinate values can also be included in the optimization problem used to place the markers. Before the model markers are placed, a single frame of an inverse kinematics (IK) problem is solved. The IK problem can be solved simply by matching marker positions, but if the model markers are not in the correct locations, the IK solution will not be very good and neither will marker placement. Alternatively, coordinate values (specified in this file) can be specified and used to influence the IK solution. This is valuable particularly if you have high confidence in the coordinate values. For example, you know for the static trial the subject was standing will all joint angles close to zero. If the coordinate set (see the CoordinateSet property) contains non-zero weights for coordinates, the IK solution will try to match not only the marker positions, but also the coordinates in this file. Least-squared error is used to solve the IK problem. -->
